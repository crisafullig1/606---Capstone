Each model should be pre - set to just download the data files to run on.

For LASER:

  EN/ES - The necessary files are preloaded where they need to be called. They will be the train.txt and test.txt files

  ML/EN - Again, all is preloaded for the code to just run. They will be enma_natural_train.txt and enma_natural_test.txt

why won't my homescreen widget display all day events? this makes it really difficult to use	0
The app is great, and I´ve started to use it rather than wunderlist. Just 3 stars because I don´t think the My Day section makes sense. Tasks flagged as to be done today, in others lists, should appear in My Day, as those are the tasks for Today, seems My Day only considers tasks added specifically to that list, and that makes it confusing and redundant, as in Planned, the right logic is applied, where you see planned tasks for today and ahead. Shouldn´t the same logic apply to the My Day window? Or I am doing something wrong?	0

This task app is the only decent option I've found for combining tasks and calendar events into one scrollable widget. Tasks can be set to repeat from the date completed, which is essential for things like haircuts and cleaning schedules. Unfortunately, neither the app nor the widget (which is especially important) has many customization options. One option I would like, in particular, is the ability to hide the widget's title bar. Obviously color and display options would be nice, too.	0

"I have used Wunderlist for about 5 years, but now its being retired. I tested and tried 10+ apps since then, and none were that great. I stumbled upon TickTick, and wish I had started using it years ago. TickTick has much greater customization options, and does a great job of incentivizing completion of tasks via feedback. It has made my life much easier. I do wish the widget had options to change how it appears, the ""to dos"" do not have breaks between them."	1

I loved this app when I tried the free version, the side tabs and all. It felt like a planner. Then I open it up and it must've updated because the looks changed, no side tabs. So I paid for the pro version to get more out of it. Nothing has changes, I go to landscape view and it won't scroll. It's glitch to. I have paid the $4.99 and it keeps telling me to upgrade. I've already paid!!! I emailed you guys and still haven't heard any support a week later. So my advice to you all, keep your $5.	-1

Excellent product!! I think this is the third time I am editing my review for this app. That's mainly because the app popped up the review request while I was planning my tasks. I should feel like I was interrupted right? No I wasn't. This app is helping me for several years I even forgot when I started using it. And I just can't stress enough how much I like it. Fantastic work guys!	1
It is a good idea, but it's not really easy to use.. in fact it's quite complicated :/ I bought premium because they advertised I could set schedules per day, and I can, but not how I had hoped. I recommend to make it simpler by allowing the user to toggle days per schedule in the routine editor, and additionally make any small changes in each individual day.	-1
"I downloaded this app on my tablet long time ago (full version) and recently also downloaded it on my phone as I don't bring my tablet with me all the time. I only use the ""task"" function, because my calendar events do not sync properly (I haven't fpnd the sync button on my phone...) and another not so funny thing for me: I am using the same account for both devices, BUT I can't use the full version on my phone (I get a message that I need to buy it (???)...) that's why I need to use my tablet (with the full version on it) if I want to add something."	0

Do you have plans to support Office 365 and outlook calendars directly. Currently, I am syncing my calendars to Google but it's not a pleasant experience as the sync keeps failing on one or other calendar. Due to this reason, I am stopping sectograph and moving to outlook widget :-( For those who are on google calendar, it's an excellent app and the developer support is awesome.

Great Concept but executed poorly. I added 2 events between 6.30am and 9.30 but when I tried adding one for 10.30am it would let me, saying it overlapped with another event which it did not. I even checked my calendar and nothing was there for that time. It's now 11.42am, I tried adding an event for 3.30pm and it said its saved but hasn't showed on the clock or anything so it's pretty useless at this point.	-1

"Decent app. Works like intended but does have bugs for the extra ""game"" part of it. constantly have to close and reopen the app because the loading bar never really loads, or white screens. Another thing is I dont think we should be paying 3 gems to change our class. I accidently chose a class when I upgraded enough, and I thought I was fine as the bottom said you can change a class later, except it didnt say we needed 3 gems to do it. I dont usually get that many gems unless i buy them."	0

great habit tracking app and you get plenty without premium. I like the premium widgets quite a bit and the extra habits. Would be better if it had the option to flag a habit as skipped rather than fail without breaking the chain for when you can't do it. E.g. In bed early when you have to stay back late at work.	1

Very nice and interesting concept but completely useless because you flipping need wifi to update your checklist?! Furthermore even if my parents didn't control my wifi and I had full access, there should be a way to see all your tasks etc at a glance without having to scroll so much.

I actually use this app for practicing flute and it helps so much. I have tried using normal timers but i usually end up and just pause it saying ill come back later and never do it but with this i can set a timer and it keeps me off my other phone apps and keeps me seated since i cant really pause the timer. And its also really nice to see my progress throughout the week for practicing with all the trees that ive planted. Overall really nice app, i highly recommend it!!!	1

The *only* part of this app that doesn't impress me is the widgets, everything else is beautiful! Good visual layouts, simple quick tracking, but enough features to be flexible for different needs. UPDATE 12/30/2019: The app no longer syncs and does not import data. I've got a handy cvs export with 3,000+ lines of habit data, thank goodness, but can no longer reccomend the app if it requires manual input to restore data.	-1

"I am liking it, the subscription model is a bit steep and harsh, especially for the full buy out at 50+ dollars.

I've noticed the Dev team is really good at responding, so I am hopeful for a response. Thanks!"	1

The app looks and feels good, but it just doesn't work for me. I wanted this app mainly for the widget but it is almost useless. When you cross of an item it doesn't show up in the widget and when you edit the list in app, it doesn't update on the widget. According to the dev it's Xiaomi's fault, which I think is a possibility so be aware of this when you download it.	1

Frustrated that all the useful features are only for premium. not complaining that they are set up that way, but that they dont let you know until you are set up.

I'm a premium user and I've bought it for about 3 weeks now.

Please try to fix this problem. Thank you!	0

LIKES ~Free; The possibility of arranging the tasks list in my own order with a simple clic ans scroll, and having it in that order as home screen widget; The possibility of having the events list widget just next to the tasks list widget. The events list also show the tasks and this seemingly appears like the rare feature of an events list and tasks list integrated on one screen. DISLIKES But it would be better if the tasks kept my prioritisation order even when they appear in the events list.	1

I liked the app and I purchased it. But I can't sync any data from old phone. And when logged out of the app, there is no way to login again except reinstall the app. So if anyone is fine with restart all the progress everytime you change phone, this app is for you. But since I like to keep my progress to the new phone, I am stop using this app and find another one.	-1
i`ll try sort that fabric out for you today...been a busy bee!	0
Just one thing and I will definitely change to 5 stars. Make the 'Quick add bar' easier to use! Just expand the letter 'ADD A TASK' in the notification bar. Or at least make it easier to reach when using one hand. I'm right handed but the 'add a task' is located on the bottom left of the bar so it's hard to reach with a thumb. Please, I believe it's not too much to ask for.	0

"Mostly works well, but I am rather disappointed with the syncing issues my wife and I are experiencing.

Please revise this app so that connectivity problems from servers can be solved. I am unable to sync some/all of my shared lists."	0

Authors: Please stop associating every extension with this app. It's annoying this pops up when I try to open a jar file. [Edit] This means that excluding certain very popular file extensions (svg, pdf, jpg) when a file is opened from the files app, business calendar opens. This means if I try to open a Bz2 file, a AndrOffice file (odt) or a Jar file (jar). It's strange for me that Open Office files wouldn't open in AndrOffice but instead Business calendar opens instead.	0
I have to uninstall it because i need more habits to track but the free version cant provide more than 5 habits.	1
Wasn't sure to begin with, as it's not all that user friendly... but how frustrating to take a chance anyway & pay for premium only to have it NOT sync with my Calendars....! Wasn't really any other reason to pay for premium except that.... What a small waste of money; it's of no use to me now! 😒	-1

The dream Task/Reminder app I have been looking for, and looking for a long time. UI, facilities, features are just amazing. Hopefully they don't ruin it by adding and updating it with pointless, unasked for features like so many other apps! I'll enjoy it while it's good! Also, please don't over saturate it with features like Essential PIM, was good at one point but now it's full of bugs and absolutely dire.	1
I don`t want to lose my wisdom teeth, they make me wise. I will soon be without a trace of wisdom	-1
I've only been using this app for a week or so but I love it. It's easy to set up and use, and I appreciate that it gives me a percentage of my successful days.	1
The creating of tasks is pretty straightforward and easy to use but I don't like the idea that tasks in filters are the same copy of tasks in lists. Sometimes I change my mind with which tasks and lists go to which filters and if I want to remove the filter then it deletes all the tasks within it as well. I want to be able to delete the filter without having to delete the tasks themselves entirely.	0

Stupid popup reminding me to add reminders or do something covers my keypad and stays for a long time with no way to close it. I can't keep checked off items.

@siratomofbones we tried but Time Warner wasn't being nice so we recorded today. :)	-1
Great, simple, and useful. I wanted a checklist that would function directly from the desktop background of my phone, and this works perfectly for that. Intuitive, easy, and reliable, and nothing more than what I want. Update:A year later & still no better task app for a Samsung. Updates only made this app better. Sublists are easy to organize. Setting controls very useful. I don't use it for reminders b/c it doesn't get my attention as well as my phone's alarm.	1
Yeah, that didn`t last long..	0

I tried out several to do apps to replace my sun-setting Wunderlist and liked this one the best. The only feature I'm missing at this point (and it is a big one, thus the 4 instead of 5 stars) is a list of all tasks/to dos. One master list of everything from all other lists is a crucial feature and very much needed! For now I am marking all tasks as important so they are all captured there as a workaround. P.s. I am loving the tags feature, and the audio when you check a task off. So fulfilling!	1

Dislike the latest widget downgrade - the loss of the ability to select multiple tasks is frustrating. Not sure how long I will stick with this app now as the widget is far less user friendly than previous version.	-1

It's a great app, keep up the good work! It has almost all features I've ever wished for in gamification. But a few things were missing/quite annoying for me and lead me to abandon this app for now. If it helps you I could write you a comprehensive list of enhancements and features that I think could make this app better. Here's not enough space for that, though. Please give a short answer of you'd like me to send you an email with the list of my thoughts. :)	1

"Requires account to use. I was just giving a simple reason why I didn't like it. But since your response indicates I don't have 10 seconds, then I'll waist 5 minutes to make you understand. The point is that it ""Requires An Account""! I don't need another stinking account to keep track of a task list. If I wanted to share on multiple devices, I would just use any number of desktop applications that I already own. I don't need another stinking program tracking my business in the sake of ""backing up my data' or make it available everywhere. I have that covered already. Just wanted a simple task list for a small price to use on my phone. But without that choice, no thanks. To act as though 10 seconds to give up my privacy is no big deal, well my information and data is not your business or any one else unless I decide I want to do that. That is what you need to understand, some customers like to have options to do something and not have something stuffed down their throat. Downloaded ""Tasks: Todo List"" and been happy with it. Donated $1.99 to developer for making app for me and not their self."	-1
Very bad app. I organised all of my activities, took me 1 hour to complete my planner, then realised that the app automatically sets the time at am, so all my afternoon activities where at the morning, for example if I had to eat at 1pm it said that I had to eat at 1am, so I changed them to pm and suddenly the app errased my whole schedule. WASTING 1 HOUR	-1

I give it 4 stars but needs main edits: 1. There got to be alerts to remind one of the activity.. not just notifications. 2. Widget should be on lock screen beside being on the home screen. 3. This app can have the option of overcoming or controlling other apps; as to prevent distraction of following the routine.	1

"Productivity gamefied! As has been said before, the natural successor to LifeRPG. Looks like they just ripped the source code tbh, but it irons out many of its predecessors bugs. Pity they monetised it in every available orifice, fukugly full screen ads, in-app purchases for trivial customisations and an absurdly extortionate subscription, all conspire to overshadow the app itself, as does the uninspired graphic design and the use of unexciting headings that detract from its ""gaming"" USP."	1

This app is so simple yet effective. I've been using it on and off for five years now, and I always seem to come back to it when I really need to focus. There are a couple of hiccups with the app but I've still given it five stars as these don't really take away from how great it is.	1

Seems like a good tool, but almost nothing that I actually need to do with it is possible without a subscription. I'd happily puchase the app, or do a free trial period, but honestly, it annoys me when companies offer a free download only to put everything useful behind a paywall, especially when they try to give a discount for a year's sub before you even really get to try the features. Nope.	-1

I love this app ❤️! I would, however, like if you could add something more to make the app feel even more polished and more peaceful. For instance: animals that wonder around your forest and the healthier the forest the more animals come or you could move your trees and add rivers. Worth the $2.00 for premium. Very good for big groups to focus. I love the store and the fact that you can buy different trees to grow, get different sounds, and music.	1

Update: dropped 5 star rating to 1star. App will not sync. I have it on Android and iPad,and neither one of them will sync to the server. App store shows 8 months since any updates. Would not have paid for premium if I knew it wasn't going to be maintained. Original review: I wanted to make something like this myself, but they've already done a great job. I feel more obligated to the daily habits I'm trying to build, and it's great that it tracks my completion streaks.	-1

Couldn't find Google Assistant integration anywhere. Even though it's been advertised everywhere when searching the web for the app. Edit: It's even in the description of the app here. That's false advertising. I will edit my review when it's out of Beta and working in the final version.	-1

It took me a while to understand how to use certain features, but once I did I found it to be EXACTLY what I needed! If Google would allow reminders to come through, it would be the PERFECT time management tool! My only thought would be if there was some sort of tutorial or guide to help know what some things were for (like when I'm changing the color scheme, I can't always tell what's what) For those not wanting their calendar clogged up, just make those things hidden after you've added them.	1

I found it odd that the app didn't have preset hourly reminders. Most people have habits that require them to do them on specific hours (for example; gyming twice or thrice a day) the app should have a feature on where you can input the exact times in the day when it should remind you Another example of this would be: Reminder: on every Thursdays at 7am and 8pm I should be reminded of (insert habit). Instead it's jungle of toggles that seem to not make sense	-1

Love it to keep track of my projects	1
I love this app so much, I've had it for almost a week and I've only found one bad thing about it. It's absolutely adorable and it's helped me stay off my phone and make it fun to do so. The problem I've had is that when I get video chat requests from Instagram my trees die but I fixed it by muting video chat requests. Overall it's super fun :)	1
This app seems great. However I switched to another app mainly because the reminder alarms and reoccurring task options are locked without premium. What the free version let's you do is fine but not impressive enough to risk a subscription billed annually. They should give a free premium preview for a week or two so this app can showcase itselbetterf. Without access to reminders it felt more like a note keeping app that i had to remember to check which hindered the promised productivity boost.	0
I like the app because it's just as it is described. It is very easy to adjust times for focus, tree species to plant, and the motivational messages that are showed keep me going forward. I don't the fact that the trees and music are both too expensive. other than that, not really any challenge	1

SO USEFUL!! I struggle with ADHD on a daily basis, I can never remember to do simple tasks and things like notebooks, whiteboards, stickynotes, alarms, they just Don't Work. But this app helps change the game dude!! It's a clever way to incentivize completing tasks, and it's helping me build better habits with the reminders and penalties for not completing it if you miss it. SUPER USEFUL!! I feel more productive and motivated to get my tasks done, I'm grateful this app exists	1
wish it wasn`t raining	1
its a cool app, it really is, but developers need to understand that a subscription based system is not for every app. im fine paying a subscription fee to netflix, or Spotify because there is new content almost daily, but i refuse to pay a subscription fee for a todo list app. make a payed app, ill buy it for 30 bucks, what i wont is give you 3 bucks a month everymonth and add yet another subscription fee to my list	0
Excellent app. Does everything you want a habit tracking app to do. Only complaint is the app counts the current day in your progress with no option to change that. So it looks like you are less successful than you really have been on a daily activity done near the end of each day. For example, if I am tracking going to the gym after work everyday and have been successful for 2 weeks, the app will show me as less than 100% successful until I indicate today is successful. Need to fix that.	1
The fact that the app does not let you use other studying apps that you have on your phone or google to find information is a bit annoying. Currently the only way to get around this is to collect all the information you need before turning on the app, but, that opens you up to distractions and wasting time.I feel like this app is specifically designed for reading purposes only, since I can sometimes finish homework before the timer runs out but the only way to stop the app is to kill the tree.	0

"Functions fine in general, easy drag to subtasks. Can't adjust the Notifications to not go through ""Do not disturb"" mode (bad if you work off shifts), can't set timing of notifications. In a productivity app, scheduling is important. Reminders require premium, seriously? I'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay $3 month. Overall: Average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions."	-1

Perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist. It has profound customization ability. The reward system is more complex than competitors. For someone with significant attention issues, this has really helped me to feel invested. Subtasks and autofails are great features. Would be 5 stars if developers: 1. Allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2. Made tutorial/videos. Full functionality will be a learning curve for many	1

Confusion regarding 'sharing' your schedule with other team members or subscibers.

Sending an invite to fellow workers results in a vague link that seems disconnected with the original intention. No 'Connect with Users' or anything other than a link. For something that's supposed to be time management related, I've wasted hours trying to figure this out.	0

Was forced to migrate from Wunderlist. My husband and I both used Wunderlist extensively - sharing and updating lists. When we were force to migrate over, it migrated everything except the lists were not shared anymore. So when I updated my list, it does not update his list. I reshaped that list and it created a duplicate list for him. This is extremely annoying because we have to reshare EVERYTHING.	-1

Works great! User friendly and comes with a variety of colors to choose from. The colors are nice and they are adjustable to your liking. Easy to organize and to navigate. It's simple and functional. I like how you can set the notification to make it stay on there forever until you swipe it to the side. That way I am still informed about something important while it's still visible on my screen in case I miss the reminder.	1

It's good that you can import from wunderlist, but the planner is missing some really basic features. For instance it's impossible to set a repeating reminder, which makes it pretty useless... And why 'My Day' doesn't automatically populate with the things you have set for the day is beyond me. Poorly thought out, as I am finding a lot of Microsoft products are these days. I'm looking for a better app.	-1

"Edit: Reply from developer says sorry if they ""offended my feelings""? Really? This isn't a dispute about feelings. To suggest such is a fallacy. Personal attacks are not welcome when discussing dislike of your pay model. Original: Everything is extra. 24h mode, colors, any default functionality will cost you more! Bad model! Because they can add and remove features and make you pay again or more. Let us pay ONCE for the app instead of you being sneaky and greedy."	-1

This app is really functional and helpful. The widget is great. Caveat: you can only track seven habits without paying. It's one time five bucks and worth it though.

Pretty good app. The thing I don't like about it is that you can't leave the app or it will reset your progress. I use my phone for homework a lot, so this made it inconvenient to use. So far I've had better success using pomodoro timers instead. Maybe make it where you can whitelist certain apps so that you can use them?	-1

CAN YOU PLEASE ADD THE ABILITY TO HEAR A SAMPLE OF THE AUDIO THEMES BEFORE YOU SELECT THEM? I tried another popular RPG checklist app and I didnt like it as much.

This app has worked great with no glitches. It does exactly what I need it to do and has had a valuable impact on my life. One minor update I'd like to see is a way to customise the category titles. Sometimes the preset ones don't match up with the tasks I do.	1

Really great tool helps me to know what do I spend my most time doing and I strongly recommend it to everyone. It would be a better experience if they could add a feature to give me the freedom to organize my own forest and change the way my trees are put	1
Really versatile app, got the premium version almost immediately. Very easy to use, love dark theme, not invasive and doesn't cause anxiety with pending habits/tasks. I'd like to see a feature added to make daily notes for each habit and one to let you chose the icon for 'other' category habits.	1

I cannot log in to my old account since I have to buy the pro version in order to log in at first. So my past progress is lost. Also, I cannot purchase the pro version neither: 'error(6)' I have reinstalled, forced stop, cleared cache, etc multiple times. I have added a paying method to my google play account as well. Nothing has helped and I haven't received an answer to my email to you yet. This makes me sad because I like the app to much to deinstall it.	-1

I'm easily motivated by things like points and streaks, so this app works really well for me to increase my productivity and decrease my anxiety. I use rewards for breaks, and find that I get unpleasant but short tasks done much more often, because I can earn breaks quickly by just getting them over with. I also get my long, complicated, multi-part projects done early. I gave it four stars because there are a couple of features I'd like to see, but it works great as is.	1

Well, based on the description of this app and what I understood I would receive has not, lived up to its description. I hope the bugs will be worked out. I emailed for help more than 24 hours ago and have not received any response thus far. It would be helpful to have a help and/or FAQ section to refer to. After only one day of using the app, I have encountered the following: 1. From calendar screen, + button does not give option for Project (only Event, Task, or Note). I have the upgraded version. 2. Settings, General, Start with... is set for Day View, but shows month instead. 3. Help & Feedback only gives option to email for help. No option to search for help. 4. When deleting an item in a series comma I do not get the option to just delete the one occurrence. Am I doing something wrong? Is there any help that I can expect to receive? I paid $4.99 for the upgraded version, and I am not at all happy. Busy people with crazy schedules need a reliable app.	-1
Good stuff, Smiles back? Why won`t you go to his concert too? :o. Wish I could instead of working on my music which is failing lol x	1

My favorite aspect of this app is the visual organization of my daily events! It's a great little widget for people who need to keep track of their life but literally always forget to open the calendar app. I would like to see more color custom options 😊	1
yeah i want to know what that is too!	0

i was invited to one on the beach but it was too short notice i mean why the hell tell you 2hrs before?? really?	0
It's a good sentiment but it didn't really work for me. I wanted to like it but the motivation for getting stuff outweighs the motivation to actually do the things you're supposed to and unless you join a guild or any sort of group, there's no accountability. If you don't want to use it as a social app, then I can't imagine mustering up the focus and drive not to just lie.	0

I tried it since it had integrated many features from Wunderlist. It still falls short. There is no option to view all to do's at once. That was the main killer for me. I'm sticking with Wunderlist.	0

: and my kid is only 3 and is stronger then me	1
This app is a great idea and I love all the features. However, no matter what I set the day start time to for daily tasks to reset, they keep resetting at some seemingly random point in the middle of the day despite me having it at 2AM, which is causing all of my evening tasks and some of my midday tasks to fail as I haven't done them yet. I'm not sure if the app thinks I'm in a different time zone or what but it's very irritating. If they fix that it's 5 stars for sure.	0
You`re not the only one surprised that FreeTDS and UTF-8 don`t 'just work'. But you`ll get it right, eventually.	1
Very good... Just one point. When listing coming up tasks it would be good to have bands of background semi transparent color to highlight today's events and next 3 days events for example to be distinguished from far future events. All in one list with no distinction tends to be overlooked	1

Where is the priority setting? My app interface doesn't match the video you created for new users. I liked everywhere and can't find any any to prioritize tasks, only set a time for a reminder. Please provide up to date instruction for setting priorities and other details for using the app. Thanks.	0
Overall, the app is pretty good. I have a few complaints, but they don't imapct the basic usefulness of the app. 1. The app doesn't make a noise when a reminder comes up. 2. It has been sporadic and may not keep a reminder posted even when it hasn't been marked complete. 3. The format for setting a reminder day is clunky. Recurring reminders are especially difficult and may not even be available (for example, there is no way to set a recurring reminder to every 6 months).	0
Love it! Gotten through a bunch of essays with this app. I love it actually let's your phone play music, which I always turn on before starting the timer. I do have one complaint, and it is a small one though- I think there should be breaks during the timer. I've needed to use the restroom a lot during studies, and I feel guilty because I'm wasting time. So I think there should be a 5 minutes break option. Maybe you're only allowed to use it once or twice per tree, depending on the time it took	1

Outstanding. I have relied on this app for years. The customization of the design colours for the calendar widget is a massive pro, as it keeps with my phone's aesthetics. The learning curve is a little steep in some cases, but the capabilities and look are worth it. With multiple reminder notifications, ability to include emojis, different colour options for calendar entries and design layout & much more, this is an indispensable app in my arsenal. Added colour options would be my one request.	1

Please bring back Wunderlist. The problem with To Do is that it's acting as a calendar app which I already have. I don't need daily tasks, reminders, add a date, etc. That's all wasted space for me but I can't get rid of it. I make lists with sub files of all kinds of info to keep at my fingertips (literally :) that's what makes Wunderlist so terrific.	-1

Really like this calendar app and would recommend to other users. Though it really does need SMS support for sending automatic reminders to event attendees. By that I mean I would like to be able to create an event and add an attendee. When the event reminder comes round I would want the invited attendee to be sent a SMS text message reminding them in advance of the event. That functionality would make it a 5 star app for me.	0

"I was skeptical at first, but wow! Yes, the req to have a Microsoft account didn't thrill me, but this has all the features Wunderlist did and more - you just need to find them. You CAN move the order of tasks manually - just do an extra long tap on the task and drag. There is also a an inbox - here it is just called ""tasks"". This app is much more flexible in terms of themes than Wunderlist was and it makes it really easy to both delete tasks and steps within a task. Switching was easy too!"	1

I only did four stars because if you want to track more than 5 things you have to pay. Also, their forums seem to only feature drug and sex addicts. It's kind of creepy really...but you aren't required to participate...so I ignore it.	1

A decent app, but for me, it's not worth paying £15/yr for, and that's at 50% off. £30 is just ridiculous for a to-do/calender app. There are other task/calender apps, just as good and free.	0

Best free calendar app I've used, syncs with Google and outlook calendars...... ....Edited from 5 to 2 stars...the video ads are too painful. I've already read the default reply to the other reviews complaining about this. I know the fee is low and one time...I promised myself I'd get the paid versions of all the free software I use once I'm not on student income. But I'm not rewarding this painful ad practice by going paid. I will pay for a different calendar.	-1

It's very useful so far, however I'm not sure if you can change your daily routine. I made one for Monday and it auto filled for every single day of the week, whereas I need them different and when I go to try and add a new task to my day that I want, it changes it for all of them. Disappointing and useless if theres no way to bypass that...might as well go back to pen and paper.	0

After trying for two weeks it is far more motivating than I ever thought! 😁 Thank you, this is finally getting me into habits I have been trying to develop. I one thing I have difficulty with is the subtasks; once I complete the subtasks they don't carry over to the next day's parent task. However, the rest of the features of this app are so great you still get 5-stars!"	1

"I quite like habitica, but this app has some issues. The biggest problem for me is that switching the to do list to ""Scheduled"" is supposed to sort the to do items by due date (that's how it works on the website), but it doesn't. That makes the to do list (in the app) useless for me."	-1

"Being a ""free version"" user, regularly. I can boast about Todoist's opening yield of tools you receive. Although they are not much different or more varied than most other task apps.

I wanted to like it... I've always drooled at the idea of having a to do list app integrate with a calender. But alas, this version is clunky. You can't delete a single date of a recurring calender event, meaning you can't flexibly plan your day while beginning with a rough outline. I switched over to to-doist and Google calender instead.	0

"Love the app. Best of it's kind IMO. Not perfect but so close! This app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks! If I may suggest: - having the "".00"" digits be optional and not by default when setting/entering goals. - having multiple reminder/notification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day (ex: 200 push ups a day, with 4 reminders so I can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits) or the ability to group habits."	1

pretty cool.. its features are much better than the previous version. However, the widget shows up too many Google Play apps pop-up advertisements, which is sometimes really irritating and takes my time for schedule planning.. (I saw a review from the app developer.. maybe, that problem could have been coming from other sources like my phone or google play app itselft, or the like.. Sorry for the comment that I have left even when I was not sure.. I thought that way because a lot of popups have ben shown when I was using this app.. Sometimes Gallery or Photo app on my phone (my phone is cheap but compact) even sometimes show up ad.. maybe that could be the real cause of the problem..)	0

Lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget. I use ToDoist for homework assignments and I used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for. Without being able to see all my parent/sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app. I went back to an old APK but then I started getting prompts that the app would stop working if I didn't update. I still use it as a grocery list with IFTTT until Keep is fixed.	-1

This app will make the reminder pop up when scheduled, but if I don't complete it by the end of the day, it will not stay on my screen. Seems like I have to try and find a different app.	0

DO NOT BUY PREMIUM Version!! App stopped synching 7/27/2019 and is no longer supported.

Premium = tracking >5 habits and syncing across devices but no more! Would be 4 stars if still supported and worked.	-1

Todoist is the cornerstone of my organizational system. I am an undergraduate student and use this app to manage my reading assignments, exam schedule, administrative deadlines etc. sync with windows 10 desktop app is awesome. I am a free user and would gladly pay a one time price for full features here but a monthly subscription is a turn off. most recent update added check boxes which confused and altered the functionality of the widget (which was wicked BTW!). please add ability to turn off.	-1

"The app would be nice and work well if it wasnt for this 1 issue but its a pretty big issue as far as daily planners go...It only shows half of a clock or calender in the create event/task subscreen meaning i can not select any times that would fall on the right hand side of the clock or I can not select a ""due by"" date for tasks because the right side of the calender is missing...I would already own the full version if it wasnt for this problem"	0

It's misleading to list data export as a reason to buy Premium, when it is not included with Premium. It would be great if you could change this to accurately describe your three tier pricing system. Additionally, the Platinum purchase option is currently showing me the full price even though it is advertising a 33% off. The greyed out full price is exactly the same as the 33% off price. Will give higher star review when these are fixed..	-1
"Love the app, I've signed up to premium a year ago and I'm continuing my subscription. I'm using the getting things done (GTD) methodology with this app. A feature idea: allow users to choose when ""today"" ends or when ""tomorrow"" starts. E.g. my day doesn't really finish at midnight every day, I consider my day finished when I go to sleep, which sometimes can be at 3-4 am. So I would choose 6 am to be my ""tomorrow"" so those tasks don't mess up my to do list on nights when I work late."	1

Easy to use. Flexible. I use the sub list feature to describe steps needed to accomplish a task. I have lists for every day of the week. Some tasks need to be done each day, e.g. wash dishes, etc. Some tasks are unique and I create them as needed. For each day I have 'to do' and 'done' sections. Once a task is completed it goes to the done section. This app helps me focus on getting things done and has become an essential part of my daily routine.	1

Very good tool to use. One suggested feature for future development: it would be helpful if an already set task could be dragged as a sub task for another already set task. When reordering tasks by dragging them, if the task is dragged over an existing task, it should automatically become a sub task there. The reverse should also be available, to drag out a sub task by taking it in between two tasks.	1
Removed two stars because of the horrible checkboxes. Changing things like that without a option to disable is a disrespect to paying customers. [previous 5 star review] Recommended for anyone who wants the most feature filled to-do list. Tested a lot of them and this really stands out. You can adapt it to a lot of workflows and the new integrations made it even better!	0

I'm using 2 calenders and 1 To Do planner not including this. All has their pros and functions I want, yet they're different in style. This is one of the best. I just love using the week view seeing at one shot, time of events laid out in planner, including notes on that day with pics uploaded if needed. It sync with my AnyDo planner which has a calender. But I just love how I can use this a bit differently for scheduling. Best if only it has a daily mood tracker added in the notes function.	1

Definitely helps me to stay organized a little easier. I personally use it in conjunction with an old fashioned pen and paper when I have a lot to get done in a day. The only complaint I have with it is that I wish I could add additional reminders for the tasks instead of having to choose a reminder time based off of a due date I set. Other than that it's great and easy to use.	1

The fact there are no predefined tasks makes it super hard to use. Or rather this will work if user can just define the task (quest) easily. Or maybe we can import (by purchasing) some set of quests.

The best Android calendar app for power users. However, since a year or so, it freezes with almost every use, making it practically impossible to use. Not sure if this is a widespread problem or just me. Support has been responsive and has tried to reproduce the problem, but in vain. The option of sending a logfile for analysis is unfortunately not available. A pity, as it is a great app; I still haven't found any other remotely as good as this one.	0

I'm new to using Any.do, so I'm still really unfamiliar with the app. I'm so far finding that the free version is quite limited... I wanted to try the free version before doing the free trial for the premium, to compare the differences. The main point I'm unhappy with, is the fact that the reminders don't make any noise, so if you're not looking at your phone, you never realize you're getting a reminder. Is there a way in the free version to put a sound to the reminders?	0

App is easy to use, but there are 2 features I find annoying. When I add calendar items that I have entered multiple times before, I would like the event data to default to the same data usually used for this event - even when I'm adding an event for the 50th time, I have to overlay the time, duration & reminder. The other is that my reminders don't always remind me (take today for example) & I would like them to keep reminding me until I clear them, even if that takes all day.	0

I honestly didn't get much chance to use the app before it stopped connecting and not letting me do anything.

I would change the days on one task and it would change it for all of them. Over all, too much work for its worth.

Great app, easy and simple to use. The ability to save different schedules and just toggle each or all of them is perfect. Have some seasonal schedules that I can just turn on or off as required, while keeping other routine schedules.	1
I'm not usually one to advertise, but SERIOUSLY, if you are looking to be more organized with your daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, or random TASKS, then Tick Tick may be right up your alley. I downloaded it about a week ago as a suggested upgrade from the GTask Tracker app (which I liked a lot) and I absolutely love this app, for real!!	1

A fun way to get into habits. Makes me want to do things in real life as I find it very rewarding. I think it would be helpful if there was a timestamp on the dailies/habits as to when you last checked the item off. I don't have the best memory and feel like some days I double up on certain tasks because I can't remember if I've checked it off or not alredy 😅 I would like to see how long it has been since I last did a task, again, I often forget. Other than that it's fantastic!	1
Very useful app for establishing good habits: I like the weekly view in particular. Also like being able to set the level of chatter and reminders done to the minimum in the free version.	1

Excellent tool to organize tasks in multiple lists. Thank you for developing it. A few more features would be helpful such as synching the scheduled tasks with Google or outlook calendar, moving set of tasks from one list to another, saving and restoring to an online account or preferably to an Excel sheet or a CSV, etc. It is working wonders for me in the current form, however would love to have these on the top. Good luck, and thanks again.	1

better than Google calendar but has bugs/for example it keeps restoring deleted events after i delete them/i cleared cache memo and restarted phone/useless/still the same banana. update/yes i did remove Gmail account but no use/it seems a bug between localhost and oppo accounts as it shows both colors for the same birthday/btw i tested removing oppo account or localhost then i get a bug free part of the calendar but it bugs again after that part. update/yes 2 entries but for a certain period.	-1
This app is an awesome (and fun) to-do list! I like it a lot and it helps me out with my life and tasks every day. However, the app crashes whenever I try to sort to-dos by scheduled and it's getting a bit frustrating.	1

Missing basics Clearing the completed tasks is like erasing history. Instead of having the completed task stack up and encumber the whiteboard, each one of thr completed tasks should appear on the calendar (as completed or as initiated on /completed on, in Gantt chart format) This is really basic guys	0
App is nice! It works fine. I think it might just be better if it can give some rewards (maybe points or what) whenever you exceed your goals. I also do not understand some items in the app like the red translucent thing that goes on when you tap the dates the 2nd time and why it decreases % when red. Maybe you can make the app more user friendly. I also sometimes feel offended by being catcalled by the app notifications. I don't think it's appropriate. Still, it's a great app.	1
One of the worst in the genre	-1
Hey, Great app, though recently I have started to experience an issue. The app is continuously asking me to refresh the background task, and as a result it's not consistently showing notification, if i forget to do so.	1
Please update the sorting algorithm to sort by due date including the reminder time in the to-do so I can see in a day which to-do comes first on top of the list.

This is a very helpful and fun way to get yourself in the habit of doing things. The Daily Tasks are a fantastic way to get your daily stuff handled and check them off within the app. You've got the ability to create To-Do lists with due dates and notification reminders can make it ridiculously simple to get even the most complex task completed. On top of all this, seeing your character earn experience, new items and getting pets and mounts turns all the monotony into a wickedly AWESOME RPG.	1

I find it a good application but I find the Microsoft service very bad, accounts are a problem and a mess always crashes without reason, so stop using email, now with this application I only opened it once and it already tells me that account is locked 😡.

"Do you love apps that design their experience to be poor unless you pay ongoing ""subscriptions"" for static feature sets that make the experience barely tolerable? Do you prefer having money siphoned from your account over and over again instead of paying a single small fee once for an app, like we used to see? Then this is the app for you! Add one more debit to your bank account they hope you'll forget about (and statistically speaking - you will) for a stagnant app you'll forget about in a week"	-1

Asks for a subscription to get all the features. I'd pay a one time fee only. Guess you don't want my money bad enough. Edit: yes I know which is why you got a negative review. I like your app. I don't like paying subs. I raised u to 3 stars for taking this so we'll. All to often devs get all butt hurt. Add a feature to buy a lifetime license even if it's 20 dollars and I'll buy it. Or give us an option to see ads without a sub at least. Cheers. Do this than 5 stars.	0

Great job on the app, for improvements sake - I would make the lists have a font size option, or something where if the 'items' in the to do list are more than a few words, they can look more organized, given that the square resides in the middle of the 'to do item', to me they seem a bit crammed together	0
Initially I thought this would be another app I get and forget about in a week. Not at all, this app is working great for me. I started planning and recording everything. It is keeping me accountable for my focus. It may sound stupid but it is fantastic.	1

Useful, efficient, and simple! While some people find the simplistic nature of the app as a downfall, I believe this is one of it's best features. I can make tasks with deadlines and make the subtasks have subtasks, meaning big projects are a lot more step by step and manageable. I've recommended this app to a few friends and would do the same thing for others, especially students!	1

Loved it untill recently when it started playing adds eveytime i put in an appointment. Now ill have to get a new calender app after years of using it and loving it. Too bad.	-1
Iï¿½m JBobsessed xD I miss them soooooo much! They should have a live web cast on bookface ? EVERY thursday xD	-1
Instrumentalists like to give singers a hard time. But the vocalist`s job is the toughest when he/she is sick.	-1

Makes sense, I`d totally show off a girlfriend by asking her to wear her high school prom dress	1
Paid dark theme. Im going behind another app	0
I used to love this app and recommend it to friends regularly. The updates have made it harder to use. I don't need anything fancy. I just need a list. I don't want to clear or uncheck all items on my grocery list, I just want to go through it and untick the ones I need today. I regret ever using the 'smart' grocery list bc now, even though I have turned it off, it won't revert to basic and my list is essentially useless.	0
the planner does not work well. when I set it as every Monday, it shows different days.	-1
I like what its trying to do and want to use it, but it's missing a few things. To-Do doesn't support formatting AT ALL (mobile or PC), and any formatting you do in Outlook is erased and spacing is messed up. To-Do has the ability to create subtasks but doesn't translate over to Outlook. The To-Do app on PC doesn't allow you to enlarge the task/note window so your forced to type in this little box on the side of the window. PLEASE FIX THESE!!	-1
yeah that will keep my mid section down	0

OMG. I`m so sorry! Anything I can do to help?	-1
Turned around my productivity life, slowly but surely. It's all in how you use it: I recommend starting slow with a couple tasks a day that you already do and then slowly adding things you find you need to do. Clean interface and helpful karma system.	1

thank you You too! I hope this turns out to be a top week for you.	1
is now on twitter.....	0
I love this app and use it with my watch but have been having a few problems. firstly I purchased the pro version off of my main google account. But the app is connecting to the other google account I have on my phone. I dont want to purchase pro a second time and the only way that I have found to disconnect it from that second account is by removing that account from my phone. Secondly, since daylight saving my events have been an hour off until I sync my events. Will change if probs are fixed	0

"The notification bar does not work. The ""Add Task"" option appears, I enter the task and click on the icon, there's just a progress spinner. The ""Close"" icon does not dismiss the notification bar either. How inconvenient. Had this issue in Oreo too. Right now I am on Nougat. Also the animations inside the app are slow. The icon where you tap to 'tick' the task is very small."	-1
Bought the pro version, amount got deducted and programer version became accessible. But after sometime its showing that i have to buy the pro version again. Kindly troubleshoot this problem.	-1
Omfg.lmao.lassetti was right... those bangs did look bad. lmao	0
good shared tasks, but app itself makes me angry.. it keeps forgetting i am logged in with my google account.. so I need to login for like each two weeks or so.. and it also forgets my settings... Edit: unfortunately this has not been fixed yet, even though I had sent logs and communicated with you. Decreasing my rating.	-1

Ace I love it	1
The interface is incredible! It's the perfect organizational app I've always been looking for. This is all overshadowed for me however by the fact that it is automatically attached to your email with no way to remove it. I would use this app daily if it would just exist in it's own bubble without needing to grab onto 3+ emails. Minor complaint but it really turned me off from the app, and if I had known this I would not have used it in the first place.	-1
Easy to use, free version is enough for my purposes	1

I have tried soo many to do apps. But this is the best I've come across. Regret that I found it this late. 😅 this is an amazing app. Great work guys! ♥️ Planning to buy a subscription pretty soon. One suggestion: Instead of billing annually, could you do it quarterly or monthly subscription.	1

I have a big problem with this app, daily routine doesn't repeat unless i complete it. But somtimes i really could not complete it. then it's stop repeating, why?!!!! plz fix it	0
when will she b finished	0
I have used several habit tracking apps and this one is the best. It is easy to use and I like the way it gives my percentage success rate and my streaks. A lot of the other apps wanted a monthly subscription fee. I paid for the pro version after using the free version since it was a one time payment.	1
Didn`t win a Lammy last night but happy for Scott Sherman, who did. Walked my feet off at BEA today.	1
"It is a pretty nice app. I really like it. But why don't you you make the ""delete completed tasks"" button? Is it something too difficult? If this function will not appear in the nearest updates I will change the app for sure."	1

This app is a very playful app. I use this app as a game. But I have faced some problems using this app. I can use other apps (phone based app/given by phone authority) while 'FOREST' app is active in the background. But on some apps (the apps I have installed by myself ) the forest app does its job. When I get into other apps the tree I have planted on FOREST app should have died but the forest app is not working on phone based app/given by phone authority.	0

I'd rather have continous ads than a payed time subscription. Honestly the subscription seems pretty shady for somethng you can easily do yourself... $3.69 for a month subscription and $36 bucks for a yearly subscription? Seriously? Why not just pay a premium one-time payment costing $10? Pathetic.	-1

hi to all twit friends happy mother`s day to all the beautiful and amazing mothers out there	1
I have been using forest since 2017 and had collected over 3000 coins. Unfortunately my phone got stolen and I had to buy a new one. Now when I reinstalled the app it's saying that I need to start collecting again and to log in I need a premium account which I have never had. How can I get my points back? Thank you.	0
I've used this app for years and have loved it up until now. Now I get full page ads that sit there for 5 seconds and disrupt what I'm doing. I don't mind a full page ad that I can back out of or scrolling ads at the bottom, but to force me to watch a 5 second ad is not reasonable. Seems like they're forcing you to pay up or move on to another app. If this continues I'll find another app.	-1
It`s sunny and I feel really well today! Yippeee!	1

After I water the plants I am headed to the farm. Don`t have any popcorn for the goats Katnip is looking good under saddle	1
I love this app! Simple, easy to use. Easy to organize or reorginaze and shuffle my tasks around as needed. This is the best task app that I've ever tried and I've tried quite a few. High five to the developer. Now I want it for desktop and across all of my devices. I hope that option is coming soon!	1
This app is the simplest thing yet it makes such a big difference in my daily life. I would only add the option to see the details of each task on the widget (right now it opens the app by default which is not a major issue but It would be an improvement). Thank you for making my life easier!	1

Great app! Just can't justify spending $8 - $10 in order to track more than 5 habits when there are other apps out there I don't need to pay for to do so. I'm switching to Loop Habit Tracker.

"My favorite habit tracking app! I am the author of multiple books on how to build better habits, and regularly speak at conferences on how to create behavioral change. This app is my secret tool for keeping myself accountable - and I recommend it to all my clients. Simple and easy to use.

I love lists, and I really love this easy to use app, however I also love making notes to myself of a *lengthy* nature (usually when I'm trying to go to sleep), like my thoughts on a subject or what Id like to talk about to a friend, it would be amazing if there was a blank note page or lined page without all the Frills of *dates and times and priority and complete* to compete with my eyes. I dislike having to have multiple apps for same basic function. I'd chose this over all others. 👍	0

Works great at keeping me organized. I have not had it long so I will have to explore the features. Update-New phone. I can now use the microphone to add tasks. This app is just smart enough.

Syncing with Alexa takes over 10-15 minutes which renders it unusable. Any.do, before you post your generic response: yes, I added the skill to my Alexa and, yes, I logged into my accounts. It syncs... kind of... so I can verify the two accounts are talking... just not well at all. When I use Wunderlist or Google Tasks or just Alexa by itself, the changes are instantly viewable across all platforms. The only reason I downloaded with app was to give me more control over my Alexa lists (which for some insane reason you cannot reorder). The extremely lag in syncing Any.do with Alexa renders this app useless. The UI looks really nice and user friendly, so I bumped it up to 2 stars.	-1

Loved this app, but recently noticed I really was't hearing the audio from notifications and for some unknown reason, although the notification volume for the pro version sounds loud at 100% system volume for notifications, this version (BC2) sounds half as loud, if that, to the point it's unusable because I rarely hear them. UPDATE: Just realized that for some odd reason BC2 calendar notification volume is mapped/linked to Ringtone volume and I had that lower than half volume. Please fix this.	-1

I think the idea is pretty good but the app doesnt work too well. It used to show me an alert whenever I opened a game or instagram but now it doesnt so I just start loosing time.

Could not get the app to save event time properly. All I wanted was to put a due date between 11:50 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on a certain day. WOULD NOT do it. The app kept automatically changing my times. That's annoying enough for me to ditch it and move on.	-1
Great for maintaining and keeping a routine. This is detailed enough to develop any kind of daily/weekly/monthly routine, and flexible enough to incorporate out-of-routine events and distractions if you use it right. It is a bit tedious for some people, (that's why the 4 stars) but they can keep it simple and high-level if they like. But, if you really want to tame that beast called your work week, school agenda, or personal days like me, this will take care of it.	1
So sorry I missed it!	-1
The #1 Best Habit Tracking app in my opinion. You can record the amount of activities you do and see the final result at the end of week. When recording your activities, It shows your average amount of the activities done during the week . This app also keeps my life back on track and reminds me what i need to do throughout the day and its very convenient. This app is extremely easy to use and it is free! I honestly wouldnt be able to live without it. Thank you. ❤️	1

Honestly the premium version is just not worth it, what's the point of having advanced calendar views and event setup and calendar import if, in every case, you can't see future recurring events? (The next event in the list of recurring appears only if you have ticked off the previous instance) In order to use a calendar efficiently for planning you ought to see what events are next, this hindrance has been made present by the users as far as 2015 (as I'm seeing online) and nothing has been done, that not only shows poor hindsight (what's a calendar without planning) but also a strikingly deaf customer service. The app is probably just as good as its free version, the pomodoro timer is ok, but the extra features are just not worth the expense for the premium version.	-1

"This app is very, very, very sexist. When you start the app up and go into the ""icon"" menu for the avatar of your ""hero"" character, the vast majority of the icons possibile to select are definitively male. Worse yet is that all of the ones 'intresting' in thier design - or portray something such as the workplace are entirely male. The few female icons avalible - more than half not even on their own- are showing an entirely narrow view with a subservient feeling in thier portrayal. The developers of this app should be ashamed of such blatant misogyny."	-1

I uninstalled ans reinstalled apps to check my theories, so I uninstalled this one, the phone was doing so much better. And I even PAID for the Pro version!!!"	-1
It doesn't sync up with Google Tasks. Not worth the change. Zapier does not work for Android. Zapier only works if you pay the Premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with Google Tasks. It does not import current tasks previously created in Google Tasks. There is no way to transfer my 144 tasks from Google to Anydo. And I can't afford $72.00 right off the bat to do it.	-1
Great App, but would be good if you could edit tasks after you've written them. Also would be good if it could have, a daily 'things to do list'on.calendar ,which could be ticked off alongside projects /tasks.	1

It's a good app, no question about it but it's not perfect. I used it for months after abandoning todoist but I'm leaving Ticktick now. It's feature packed but not as polished as other products. The UI is not great and the app has very different design language as well as features depending on which device you open it on. This lack of consistency as well as poor natural language support doesn't make it the perfect ToDo app.	0
happy mother`s day mothers.	1
I Love this app. It helps me stay organized and reminds me about every single task I have. The UI is great, and integration with Outlook (flagged emails) and windows is exceptional I'd also love the idea option to 'review my day' to know exactly how much I got done; and integration with Outlook's calenders - that would be nice... Microsoft has some amazing apps and getting to use them all ends up feeling natural... Hats off to the developers	1

I have to agree that the full-screen time-draining ads are not viable for a Business Calendar, regardless of the reasoning behind it. By all means, keep the small rolling ads along the bottom of the screen or alternatively charge a more reasonable fee to go pro. £6 is not an option when there are so many other options out there, such as aCal (which I used to use before BC and am now reverting to)... I'll keep an eye on Business Calendar though because, if you change the ad situation or make the pro price more reasonable, I'll certainly be back!	-1
awesome..am headin there that nite after my grad dinner c u then boi! hehe	1
Just study according to the notes that you had to copy and you`ll be fine.	1
I like the app a lot, but some features are a little annoying. I have a few suggestions. - More ways to tweak what the widgets look like (currently they take up a lot of space). - It would be nice to see the completed tasks together with active tasks instead of them disappearing. - Task subcategories! Please! 💚 - Biggest gripe: because of the way the entire list item is like a button, I keep accidentally checking tasks that weren't actually done. +Bugged unchecking. Pls fix. Thanks💚💚💚	1

Great app! A good replacement for Wunderlist. Supports all platforms, and has all the important feature whilst remaining very easy to use (unlike some of the competition). I would love having a slightly better widget. The current one doesn't look very good (the tasks aren't in boxes), and there's not a good support for RTL writing. I suggest aligning the text to the Left even when having RTL text, so every task is on the Left side and it's not mixed up.	1

This task app has been very helpful at organizing things that I do on a daily basis especially making list for shopping or getting gifts for friends. I've never personally used location tracking so that I can list out a specific location but I'm sure that it works perfectly fine as long as your GPS works as well. I would definitely recommend this to those that are looking for more organization to their day! 5/5 stars.	1

A few major issues: 1. The addition of sections in projects is nice, but not useful if they only appear in project view but not filters. 2. The sections cannot be reordered to appear at the top of a list, the can only be at the end of a task list. 3. In filtered view, pulling subtasks out of their parent task or non-completable tasks is ludicrous. Duplicating them like that is silly at best.	0

There seems to be no way to actually mark a task as complete, so I had to delete the tasks I actually did complete and therefore have not gotten in-game rewards. There is also no way at all to contact support. If you join the Habitat Help Guild that is supposed to allow you to ask questions, there is no obvious way to post a question there. There is a button to leave the guild but not one to post a question. This app is terrible and is a waste of time.	-1

I've just installed this app and so far, it seems like exactly what I had been looking for! Kudos. I just have one suggestion. The app exits on pressing the back button once. Most apps exit on pressing the back button twice, which works great for the user experience, in my opinion. So, it would be really great if you could incorporate that. Hoping to use this app every day!	1
"Very long time user. Latest updates are making things harder. Subtasks in recurring parent tasks are now automatically archived when completed and don't seem to reappear when parent task is due again. Example: I have a weekly todo titled ""Groceries"" with grocery items I need to buy as subtasks within that recurring parent task. Whereas before I could mark a subtask as complete and expect that same subtask to reappear next time when I go shopping again, it's now completely gone."	0

Only 4 star as the walkthrough wasnt close toenough to get to grips with the game fully, i still dont actually know why my health resets or how to increase health dispite adding healthy eating and exercise. it seems like there is some mechanic somewhere to battle with your guy, but not explained anywhere, adding in some kind of quests or mini-game would be the icing on the cake	1

Can only track 5 habits, but there are discussion forums. Most of the forums have no activity going on, but there are still a few users to talk to. Often times the app no longer syncs me to them, just like right now. The quotes have been stuck, too. Developers no longer support this app. Do not buy the premium version, as you will NOT be able to sync across devices. There are no more updates or customer support. This could have been the absolute best habit tracking app. So much wasted potential.	0

Excellent and useful! I wish I had a smart watch to put it on but it's good on my phone too. Occasionally the widget can glitch and turn invisible but it will come back. The outside clock face numbers are only black? Can't see them on my background and can't figure out how to change them. The widget palette is great, but I can imagine customization with background images of clock faces, different hand shapes, and/or color gradients to make it look really impressive!	1

the app is good and I've switched to it from TickTick but then i switched to Microsoft Todo because of the design mainly but that's not the only thing. don't get me wrong it works but there are way to many features that are premium at least make the reminders a free feature because that is just absurd. maybe fix the design, add an all black theme and make the reminders a free feature but all in all it's great	0

This is a decent time managment app. The ability to create routines is handy, though it doesnt warn you or show if activities are overlapping. The most recent update (as of 3/30/2020) made the app look much cleaner, which is nice. I would like to see more personalization options t'wards the look af the tags and app. Choices now are very slim. The $5 price tag for the pro version doesn't feel worth it (yes, buyer's remorse), so if you can manage fine with the free version, stick with that.	0

This is a great app, and would be 5 stars. The reason it isn't, the early reminder notifications stopped working for me, at all. They had been working fine, then for no reason that I can find, they stopped. I've tried reinstalling the app, but this didn't fix it. I am getting a reminder at the time my tasks are set for (or 3 - 4 minutes late) though. It's incredibly frustrating as this is the only app I've found that offers early reminders, and I'm trying to use that to complete tasks on time.	0

Best app for time management	1
I'm surprised, this app actually works for me! It helped me procrastinate less, but I also realised it works only if I remind myself to check the app a lot. I recommend it for those who have really bad procrastination problems like myself. Even if the game style of this app isn't your thing, it's a great to-do-list app for habits, daily reminders and general to-do items. Only complaint is it's glitchy for me when I want to customise my avatar.	1

Not all tasks reach completion, some need to be deleted and rightly so. But by design delete action is tucked away under three dots menu and then behind confirmation message. Thus making deleting tasks in bulk deliberately harder, probably to keep fake karma number high and jack up usage statistics.The swipe action on the list should be customisable so delete action can be set when its swipe left. Also since recent updates the upgrade to premium nudge is slapped everywhere.	-1

Happy with the App...but personally I had two issues which are if addressed, may provide sort of convienience to the users. 1. If any task is not completed and deleted by mistake it can't be undone that I felt inconvenient to write the task again. 2. If any task is being feeded and there also undo/redo options are not available	0

I love the app but a possibility to put in task progress (0-100%) would be great! In the updated version when I select the filter 'view all' on my widget the subcategories are gone... And now all tasks are only ordered by priority without regard for category. That is very very confusing!! Please bring the categories back!! Or at least an option to show them again.	0

Need to be online to use this app. In case you make changes in offline mode. It doesn't sync automatically when online. You need to again make those changes. Enable offline feature and offline data should be synced when ever we are online. Once this is done, you got my 5 star.	-1

I love this app ; the only thing that would make me like it more would be if the text wrapping on the sections made more sense. Sometimes the titles of my events get cut off and placed in odd spots in the sectors. Also I've found the colors are very limited. When it looks into my calendar to match the color my calendar has for events, it gets it wrong or doesn't have the color.	0

This is a great app! The ability to track my habits and edit them as needed is really awesome. There are just 2 things I'd really like to see that would make this a 5-star review for me: 1) Full editing options (currently can't edit the frequency for my times per period items), and 2) A help/glossary feature. I'm not sure exactly what the link icon means, as it is 0 on items I've not done or done once, but 1 on items that I've done twice or three times.	1

Been using this app for a year now, and have created something like 20 lists that contain sublists, reminders, to-do's, groceries, pretty much anything and everything, and I've been so pleased with the whole experience.

The UI is not attractive, to begin with. Text overlap and the fact that the only screen orientation available is landscape immediately turned me off to the app. The layout is not bad and puts all the information right in front of you but it looks as if it was built for Windows 98. I certainly was not willing to pay for the full version when the free version was so flawed. I can find better free apps with more functionality than the paid version of this one. It needs some work.	-1

Really cute app and I love it. But I wish there was a feature where you can pause the timer? Take a short break then resume studying. It'll be really nice	1
Best to-do app I have used. It offers most of the features that other similar apps also offer, in a very simple user intefface: organize your tasks into lists, use tags, create smart lists, use two-way sync with Google Calendar. Finally, what makes it Excel over the competitors for me is that it also works as a daily/weekly planner, since the calendar view allows to drag and drop pending tasks into the day/week and also schedule start and end times for each task.	1

I'm enjoying the user interface. It's has a nice aesthetic and more importantly has pretty much everything I need for putting down my tasks. However, the widget keeps freezing on my home page, and my completed tasks for a particular day don't show up in the app for that day.	1
Lol Your tweets are so funny! I met you in Calgary! You`re awesome Can`t wait for the next HP movie!	1

I used to like this app, it is simple and easy to use. but lately it keeps deleting subtasks, or not saving correctly, so I go back to do thing I needed help remembering, it to find it gone. it also could be a lot easier to add a reminder notification	0

I`m enjoying this Sunday very much. No parents. No revision. Just like any other Sunday	1
It's okay, but I migrated from wunderlist and I still miss it. Plus the widget keeps on breaking, not showing any tasks. When I delete it and put it back on the screen, it works again but only for a few days. Please fix this!	-1

It's a great app. Really nice features. Does everything it says on the tin. But let me tell you: a productivity app won't do what it's meant to do unless it's usable offline. I really loved using it, but now I'm going back to the good old bullet journal.	-1

Sencilla, práctica, y cumple como debería. Si buscás una app para anotar tareas o recordatorios está es la indicada. Lo mejor es que puedes tener la app tanto en celular como en ordenador y lo que anotas en uno se actualiza en el otro.	1

Subscription based (if you want non-trivial repeating tasks and no task repeating on completion option either), rather pay more upfront, uninstalling will stick with Toodledo.	0

Nice idea, but the problem is that i tried to see what happens if i close the app and use other stuff like games, it said that the tree would wither, but when i come back after playing the tree is still growing. Is this normal?	0

Great app and service! The user base is amazing and the staff is awesome. No notification when a challenge ends and no way to automatically remove its associated tasks. Can't read the full text of challenge tasks before joining. The health/experience widget doesn't display any information.	1
I have the app on my phone and my iPad and they do not communicate. Everything that I input on my phone, I have to re-input on my iPad. I'm signed into the same account on both. It would be nice if they would communicate. Also, I don't understand why the computer app is available separately and for a much more expensive price...	0

This app keeps getting closed in the background on a clean android. I'm using it on OnePlus 7 with Android 9. Reminder notification doesn't show up at the time I set.

It does not remind with a pop up notification continuously for consecutive days even when the dates are saved and the notifications are not on the home screen and therefore often missed.

Amazing . It really helps to focus on important tasks rather than wasting time on useless apps . A huge plus ( in my opinion ) is the fact that when you upgrade to PRO you can plant real trees only using coins you've collected in the game .	1
This app is really very useful, but it would be better with a feature that import the routines created to other calendar apps (through gmail or some sort), as for laptop uses. 🙏🙏 Other than that, it is awesome, would definitely recommend to my friends, keep it up!! 👍💪	1

However there are a few bugs. Every so often one of my recurring tasks will appear twice on one day and I have to delete it. The synchronization with drop box isn't good enough to use on two devices. I would be useful if you could choose 'third Sunday of every month' for recurring tasks	1
It's a good app. I like the encouraging reminders and memes each day. I wish there were just a couple more openings for tracking, but overall it's good. It doesn't eat my battery like the last one I tried. In fact. I'm readjusting to use in the coming year.	1

The idea is great, but it doesn't help me with my goals. The thing is: i have to use it on silent and facedown, so others notifications (and lights) don't bother me. Here lies the problem: when the time runs out, the app doesn't vibrate... Cause of that i have to constantly check the hour, which is not good at all for me. I'm using a galaxy s7. Edit- See, that's the prob. I did everything in the answer, except turn off the silent mode... As i said, there's no use for me if i have to do that! Tks anyway.	0
Great app.. please add the ability to see when recurring habit is due.. or by automatically completing a habit which is not due, i.e. required once a week for example..	1

It would be very useful to set fights event with different time zone. 3)the location link should be synchronised with Google maps results, not with the contacts, in order to have the right response for the addresses.

A very good to do manager. I would take a premium version if on the Windows version it would possible to set/change/manage location reminders. For this feature I already wait some years. I'm really surprised that the programmers are not able to add this feature also at the windows app. It's annoying so anoying that you have to edid every task in Android again to add a location reminder..... But it seems to be to difficult for the programmers...??? So when this is to difficult what can we expect? Will the maintanance of the Windows app stay on a reliable basis??? Waiting already since years for a change. Didn't know why the ask me to change settings on Android to change place reminders on my Windows TickTick... May be I should give up 18.10.2019	-1

Love this app!! It helps to keep me focused while studying. You get really invested in planting your trees and seeing them live, which is a good deterrent from checking social media and texts. I enjoy how you can work towards new types of plants and get some variety in your forest. I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a little push with no (real) consequences to stay focused.	1

Great app for succeeding with your good habits. The widgets are especially useful since you are constantly reminded if you haven't completed one of your habits. I also like the discussion page but I miss some sort of timestamp to show when the post/comment was posted. Sometimes you reply on a post that has been dead for quite a while without knowing it.	1

A software expert. Just purchased this app. It's generally OK, but I am not very impressed. The most glaring issue is that you are confined to the app's predetermined reminder intervals. you have NO option to create your own time intervals (i.e. 12 hours before, 18 hours before, 4 days,5 days before, etc.). They say this app is customizable, as long as it's the developers choice of customizations. look elsewhere if you want total customization. I'll look for more deficiencies and report back.	0

Крутое приложение! Вероятно, перейду на премиум подписку. Тем не менее есть один нюанс, что мне не понравился и пока не смог найти решение. Когда в проекте создаёшь задачу и для нее указываешь под задачи, то они отображаются с отступом. Если все эти под задачи назначить на выполнение на определенную дату, то во вкладке Today, все задачи будут отображаться одним сплошным списком, без какого либо визуального разделения на задачи и под задачи.	1

I've had this app for a while and I love it. But after the last update it hasn't notified me that my time is up. The tree is planted but my phone doesn't go off. All the notifications it could have are turned on, so I don't know why this is. Help, please?	1
I'm very sorry I bought the full version so quickly. The only benefit I found so far, is the ability to add more than 7 habits. I couldn't find a report that would provide information about my success and pinpoint areas that I seem to regularly miss. I was drawn to the simple UI but will probably write this off as a waste of money and return to Daily Tasks.	-1

I use Todoist every day and it is awesome service in general but the latest update to the widget made it absolutely unusable for me. It has too slim lines even without compact mode (compact is ridiculous, even though I have small fingers), the quick button to open the main app is gone and the WORST - it is now not possible to select more tasks and do anything quick with them. Bye bye fast rescheduling... I am greatly upset, it is my main tool for staying on track.	0
I really wanted to like this app, but it's just too buggy. Sometimes I open the app and it doesn't have the icons to switch views. Also the 12-hour formatting is really flawed. And the priority scale seems way too complex. High, medium, low should be enough for most people.	-1

The new design is atrocious. Before you could swipe left or right to see coinciding days which made for easy comparisons and changes. You can't even scroll back up once the time has passed. Now its just one LONG, CONTINUOUS list. Takes 3 times as long to readjust. Just TERRIBLE. 2 stars until a more usable design is reintroduced.	-1

Im fine also..up way to early..lol...soo those r all ur dogs? to kut3 ..i def want a pit! lol	0
Purchased, but a disappointment. After phone boot, the widget is all black until it completely loads; and is annoying! Ideally, the developer should cache calendar entires to prevent such issues, and refresh once the app is fully up and functional. The issue is prominent with Nova Launcher on Oreo 8.1 on TugaPower ROM for the OnePlus One.	-1
_0981 LOL I was going to do some homework, but kind of got distracted... Again... Goodnight!	1
I gave it a lower rating because lately if I had any repeat scheduled appointments, I can't change one without changing them all. Very aggravating. Before, I was able to cancel one without affecting all the future repeat weekly or monthly entries. Before, I could use this calendar to keep track of my past activities. Now it looks like I attended a meeting when I didn't because I couldn't cancel it without affecting future meetings	0

Using the free app works for what I need. It helps me put down my thoughts of what I need to get done later when they pop into my head. When I have the time later I check it and see all the things I normally forget about and get them done. Sometimes the reminders are annoying and I'm sure they're a way to turn them off but they do remind me to check out what I've out down.	1

The app design looks nice, and has good features. This is a functional planner app. I can access the week view in the free version (though a prompt to upgrade to premium pops up), but tasks cannot be set as recurring in the free version. This is a main feature I'm looking for in a planner app. Also, the look of the app cannot be customized- stuck forever with that purple at the top of the screen. There are other free apps that include these things.	0

"I like this app and I bought Premium, even it was a little expensive (5,49 Euro). What I don't like is: Habits ""with a numeric value"" don't allow ""at least 0 times a day"".

Tasks/Habits which are marked as undone may be send to the bottom, too (-1 *). Whitout Premium you only can scedule up to 7 habits! After a removal of any named defect I will change my rating."	0

I created a task for picking up groceries and set it to a specific day. Why in the world would the default setting in this app be to override my *do not disturb* setting and ring+vibrate at 5 o'clock in the morning on that day. Even though I like the apps functionality I would never recommend it to anyone with these default settings.	-1
For something that is supposed to comprehensive, I am disappointed that the app lacks allowing you to set a start date, end date, and designate progress for tasks. This app doesn't meet my needs, as most of my tasks are not associated with a single date.	-1

This is wonderfully simple and functional app UPDATE 4/30: Lately I've been running into some limitations of this app. For example for some reason could not sort tasks when looking at the label, or on start screen. What is more troublesome are latest updates. For some reason they removed ability to customize start page. That's the feature I relied on day to day. They have also made mobile app LESS convenient to use. I am now afraid to complete tasks by accident due to change in app layout.	0

HabitNow is a great app. Well thought out and the colours are good! No dark mode in free version but I don't see that as a reason to give less than 5 stars. Has helped me to organise aspects of my life.	1

Cool app!	1
i hate how you cannot open the app and see all your lists there. you have to have one open at all times and it does not show a list of your list on the home screen. deleting this app for this reason. too bad... the rest is great. but they need a home screen. they don't have one.	-1

I am a vanilla habitician, but that game failed to serve it's purpose several times and I eventually quit. I linked it to several systemic errors. I was even thinking about creating my own habit rpg free of those but then I found Do It Now. Not only it answers all of my concerns it even adds more features, like drawbacks for completing certain tasks (anti-procrastinator) or putting player in position where he has to maintain his characteristics. Amazing, thank you devs. Please port it to web.	1

"love the tracking, love the accountability. I use the widget, but I dont like that you can't split habits into ""profile"" type structures. for example, an ""AM"" Routine list of check offs, and a ""PM"" Routine. maybe those and a list of habits you just want to complete daily at any time. that would be a game changer for me. I've considered other apps because of that one missing feature. I dont like how the widget groups every single habit Into one list. I want to split habits up between multiple."	0

"I have been using this app ever since I switched to an Android phone 5-6 years ago, and I have liked it for the most part. However, the recent addition of the ""focus"" button in the pop-up reminder bar is annoying. Focus is only available in the premium version and there's no way to turn it off. Time to shop for a new to-do list app."	0

"Now down to 1 star for the unappreciated bilingual holiday settings for BC Canada. Absolutely no need for this. The phone and app setting where the language is set to ""English"" should override any other situation. I didn't get a satisfactory answer from the dev. I'll keep deducting stars as long as the app doesn't improve. Update Feb 2018: 1 star for the completely uncaring attitude re: ""French"" in the holidays that I have no way to get rid of!

Love this app. Got the pro version. It will save a lot of my cognitive work! Please fix this bug: The colour of events are set to blue when the event is created using the default colour of the (sub) calendar. Overall the app needs better UX design w.r.t the complex menu for customization and some other things e.g it was hard to figure out how to get separate widget for different calendars. But in terms of functionality it is awesome!	-1

Good idea, implementation to be revised. The management of the task is not clear. The dates are showed in a confusing way. Again, the concept is good, but the user interface has to be improved and updated.	-1
Star Trek was GREAT yet minor details needed to be worked out, but I give it a Thumbs Up, regardless!	1
This app has been great for keeping my goals on track! I have the free version only. Supposedly, the paid version does not sync as it's supposed to so I would be wary of that if you were considering going premium.	1
I like the concept because I've been trying to gamify my free time for a while, assigning a predifined score to each habit practiced the most during every hour, and all I wanted was the positive and the negative habits to affect the same progress bar, with the possibility to keep track of a daily score, with a possibly negative value. It's a damn shame but this aint for me. I wish it was more customisable	-1
I was supposed to go boating/songwriting in Cape Cod.. but its cold and rainy	0
Downloaded this app hoping for a fun way to form new habits, but when I get to the register screen the first two tutorial panels are blank and then the third one lets you link social media accounts. Then I can't save the username and display name I create, and the avatar generator screen doesn't load any options. Opened the app the next day to find nothing I could edit had been saved. Uninstalled and tried registering again with a different account and got the same results. Pretty disappointed	-1

I had hope for this Calendar app but apparently in order to see the calendar in a normal format as to the list format, you have to pay a premium, & that is not what I want to do.

Wow	1
A great idea, and the app itself has been improved a fair bit, but still a little bit too slow to respond to give five stars. Seems a bit like server congestion maybe?	1
Wow. That hurt way worse than i thought it would.	-1
I recently switched over from the original business calendar app which I have been using for many years. This version has a fancier UI but functionally seems much the same as far as the calendar goes which is fine, if it ain't broke don't fix it! I think other features have been added but I don't really use them. Update: full screen ads suck. They appear and cannot be closed for a long time. Show me an ad if you must but let me close it, the free version is unusable this.	-1
The only drawback of this app is that you need to add events or tasks or routine to your Google calendar in order for it to show it in the app. It would be great if such events could be added on the app itself.	1
Makes doing chores seem more achievable and really helps me see my progress in being a better human.	1

Excellent app, have it synced with about 8 calendars so I can get everything in one place. It works - I wish everything in the App world worked so well.	1
The app was working great, up until recently! Now i cant click on the date, and update it directly through the widget. I have to open the app and make changes through there. What happened! :(	0
This app claimed it was syncing to the cloud. When I lost everything on my phone and had to reinstall it, signed in, and tried to sync ... there was nothing. I have an open support case that nobody at Habitbull has responded to (#900271) Do not trust this app or whether it will backup your habit tracking data. Terrible customer service and fail of an app.	-1

This app has helped me get back in track. I started out reading my Bible every three days, and ended reading it every single day. If you are struggling with a bad habit, this is the app for you. I have tried many different habit trackers before, but this has been the best thus far. It shows you your progress percentages too, which is a really cool feature. Highly recommended.	1

I have bought once, and uninstalled, but this time I installed it again and had to pay twice.	0
So it's good. I payed for pro but the issue I'm having is adding my routine to my timeline because whenever I try and add it, it takes me to edit my routine. It's really annoying because I'd like my routine in one clean place. If this is fixed I'd definitely rate it 4 stars	-1
Almost perfect, the only thing I wish was different is I wish all my lists were available on a main screen & that they were clickable from there. I don't like that it stays on one list instead of a homescreen instead where all lists available at a quick glance instead of having to go & open the tab to see the lists. I'd use it a lot more that way.	1
It`s pretty perfect eh! Yes We Cannabis! I saw some of those signs at the Global Marijuana March too.	1
It's super helpful but why do all the multiplayer functions suck or not exist on mobile? Edit: I'd really like to do the missions and stuff but I'm not really in this for friends. I'd like a way to find a group on mobile. Maybe a random matchup option?	1

Pretty good, only issue I noticed is that if you undo claiming a reward that has its price increase each claim it can give you extra coins back. Aside from that, a lifetime purchase option would be nice (I try to avoid subscriptions where possible, so I'm sticking with using this for free for now), and an option to hide the parts that require a subscription instead of showing them but asking you to pay when you click them would be nice. (e.g. so the calendar doesn't even show up on the bottom).	1

Здравствуйте, ваше приложение мне очень помагает в работе и рутине. Очень обширная программа с множеством функций. У меня предложение ! Как вам идея добавлять собственные иконки к задачам, как например к аватарке героя. Мне кажется, что среди всех иконок может и не быть нужной. Иконки же дадут возможность максимального представления о задаче. К примеру я занимаюсь пайкой и покупаю различные модели паяльников, радиодеталей. Хотелось бы добавить изображение конкретного елемента. Будет круто!	1

Really unique app that motivates me to get stuff done. Unfortunately, this app needs A LOT of work. I tried writing a message in a guild chat. Once it got long enough, the words disappeared behind my keyboard so I couldn't see what I was writing. When I put the keyboard down, the send button disappeared..as a result I couldn't send my message. Theres no search for trying to find a challenge that suits you. Theres no notifications when your party is chatting. There is also no search for guilds. I just started this app and so for these are the problems I've noticed. Otherwise it is great and I hope it improves.	0

todoist is the best I've found for allowing me to create to do lists and then assign tasks dates and times later, while syncing with Google calendar.

Had been very good. But now any reminder that is not completed by the end of the day gets marked as complete inatead of showing up as overdue. On repeating tasks, sometimes marking today's as done will also mark 1, 2, or even 3 days into the future as done, with no pattern behind the glitch. Has become very cumbersome to use and has resulted in many tasks getting missed.	-1

I upgraded to Pro after a couple of weeks & initially excited about the app. Having used it for a while now I'm starting to regret my purchase. There are some pros but more cons. It's buggy, doesn't sync well at all across devices, the UI is very cluttered, the forum needs serious updating, a search tool for eg. The last update was ages ago, given how pricey this is you'd think the developers would make it worth it but they seem to have disappeared!	-1

Overall I love this app and find it very useful. My main issue is sometimes my reminders don't pop up? Which is kind of irritating considering I use it to remember my birth control. When it doesn't remind me, I'll often completely forget to take it or remember a few hours after when I'm supposed to take it. Like I said, love this app and use it to track when I go to the gym or remembering my pills. Just wish my reminders would work :(	0
The idea is great, and I would have loved this. However I WILL NOT pay to be able to use different routines for different days. This app is nothing more than a way for them to trap you into payment. Don't bother with this one.	-1

"There's quite a lot of work to do with this app. While it seems to functionally work well on a basic level, a lot of core features from the Wunderlist app have been removed, or awkwardly placed/restricted. New features of the app are incredibly limited and feel poorly executed. Unfortunately there is nothing in this app that says ""I want this"", when migrating from Wunderlist, and makes other apps look more appealing. I hope further updates from Microsoft can deliver on user feedback."	-1

I just want to say that the tutorial was too much info, things like this should be explained in a short and concise way, at a good pace. It was just too long and too much to take in. I didn't even try the app though, I can't say what rating it deserves. I am unnistalling but I may come back to it in the future, it's not you, it's me. (Also, you can't delete your account on mobile but you can on desktop. I suggest people to try the desktop version since it may have more features)	1

It would be better if there are more options for customising the avatar and theme which is in purple. You will need to spend money for a decent background. The avatar is pixelated and doesn't look good. Getting a bit bored of it now.	-1

Adding names to my Twitter account and learning how to use this amazing thing!	1
Excellent app that not only has to do check lists but habit tracking also covered, what I loved most about the app is the 'your thought' that pops after completing the habits...genuinely thank you for such app creator..	1
I love the app but I wish there was a separate page for notes. (I know that you can add notes when you create a task), but I'd like to see a designated page just for notes. Other than that I never liked subscription models, I think way more people would actually buy it, myself included if it would be a one time fee.	-1

Turn over report...done	0
having my brecky. Good Morning x	1
no new tubas until 4th of july weekend	0
The best thing about this is that it is free. No annoying ads but I get all the features. Some of the UX on here just isn't as good as other apps. For example, My Day makes no sense. Why do I need to add everything into My Day manually when it is already due today? I need to click an extra button to see the tasks.	-1
Cant add widget to home screen. Configured the app, added task list and tried to drag the widget to home, shows up nagging popup to select theme etc. Does nothing even after configuring the app. Won't recommend it.	-1

This app don't even deserve 1 Star but no other way. In year 2020, an app that just share task with other but not the time which is not that worth. Secondly, no themes, no fun. Give up this app.	-1
good day	1
hey Twitters	0
I used this app for a long time. But now, I don't know what happened. The alarm doesn't ring and the notification bar isn't working. The reminders don't work as well. I don't know why, but this app is working worst everyday...	0

The idea is great. I've used it many times to stay focused and stay on task. I enjoy the fact that you can write lil bios of on your trees. However, the app would be tremendously more useful if I were able to restrict certain apps for a period of time rather than not using my phone at all. I still want to use certain apps, like music and reading apps, rather than not having access to my phone at all.	1

it’s a great app and works great. helps me keep track of whether or not I took pills or did excercises or not. However it lacks the feature of ”multiple times a day” So if for instance a person was trying to create a habit to do something twice in one day. this app won't help since you can only click that you did it once. Does anybody know if thier is an app that has this feature?	0
aww loves you! way too cute ;)	1

you were right about karla not the best movie made	0
As soon as I downloaded the app and made a new account, I couldn't create a new character because under the body, skin, and other options to make your character was blank. When I changed my display name, I got a weird message for 'profile.name' required. The randomize button didn't even work for me either. I left originally because there were many bugs with to-do's and other things and I'm not confident it's functional past the character creator, so I don't see a point to continue. On the S10E	-1

"I use it as an integral part of Office365 online services and especially the Outlook/One Note combination as a means of staying on top of tasks within longer term projects.

The UI is neat with pleasing graphics. It is straightforward to use = no frills. I just wish it can accomodate 6 people and the notes feature is available to use (it is a premium feature, but it would be nice if there is a character limit, as a compromise). The app supports syncing with calendars. But imo, a todoist calendar option will be better - no added step of linking and maintaining the other calendar's data integrity. All in all, this is an app with potential	0

This is a great calendar app and it also connect to your other Calendar apps, like your Google, Microsoft, Samsung and so on. Keeping you in touch with every calendar that you have on your phone.	1
While everything else about this app is good, the process of scheduling a task is frustrating. Half of the time, it fails to recognize what I'm trying to set. You should just bring back the old scheduling layout from a few years ago. That was easy.	-1

I wanted to like it, iinitially it looked great but it has such a limited window of time view it's no good for planning. A few hours view and that's it. Scrolling hour by hour day by day? Useless. Its sole function appears to be to tell you what you've got coming up in the next few hours which frankly is not much use to anyone as far as I can see. Cloud Cal uses similar circles with a view of the whole month which would be great but sadly the pro version doesn't work so no go there either.	-1

Looks very appealing and has support on multiple platforms however having basic push notification for individual tasks behind a pay wall is pretty stupid and makes it the app untempting to switch to. I would reconsider if the paywall wasn't a subscription or rather have the reminders as a separate one time purchase.	0
"Update 04.2020 - this is getting worse and worse still, with every update. Now they made it harder to edit your task - they moved it behind two clicks. Why?? Seems like this app is moving away from the todo-app for power users to just another todo app, same as any other. This is the last time I paid for the premium subscription. Time to move. ----- It used to be the best for power users, but after the latest ""updates"", the app keeps getting worse and worse. I am not really sure who this updates are for, definitely doesn't seem like it's for its core user group."	-1

This app used to be brilliant. It then began to function regardless of whether you were using your phone or not- essentially just becoming a basic timer. And then now the timer fails and kills trees when youre not using your phone. I just planted a tree only for it to die 20 seconds after when my phone locked.	0

It's a good start...I currently have a 1 month subscription. Needs more habit type features. Needs to track , display and keep a record of current and longest streaks. Repeat option needs much more options like; 1. A way to track a task that's done a certain number of times a day like 3 times a day. 2. Repeat week, should also have the option to have the task done a certain amount of days not just on specific days. 3. Achievements should have an option for completing consecutive days.	0

They changed the priority colors, so that instead of a gradient, it now goes grey, blue, yellow, red. I don't think this is an improvement - it is not immediately apparent to me which priority blue is at a glance. They also took away the priority color strip on the left and replaced with a colored checkbox. It looks worse to me. I'm not sure this was necessary, just so that the user could close out a task with a single click.	0
habit syncing not working on paid version. app is great, but after phone resets and all my habits data of 2 months is lost. And the app is showing i don't have a internet connection even though i am writing this review on same internet connection.

"--- EDIT: there is some annoying bugs when assigning a date: ""tomorrow"" is sometimes sent to next week and ""next week"" the week after.

I would be happy to pay, but a monthly fee is difficult to justify by the extra features being offered. At least not for my usage."	-1
I like the app but there is one thing that annoys the hell out of me. I use a number of sublists for shopping. Whenever the screen changes orientation or Auto rotates the app defaults back to the first sub list and I have to reopen the one I was working with. Very annoying. Update; My opinion of the app is unchanged, but snarky respones from the developer are uncalled for. I get it, it's free, and I'm not using a lower end device. Maybe find a new hobby if you don't like comments.	1

The simplicity is nice, but sometimes I want something with more detail. I use it in conjunction with another app. If I don't have a lot of time to enter info, it's great for that. I like that you can change the background to dark which isn't so jarring if you are using just before bed and are trying to avoid being stimulated by technology. I do wish, though, that you could change the setup of a Habit entered between a simple click or entering more detail. Right now you have to create a new Habit if you want to change, but then that changes your stats.	1

App still needs a lot of work. It's not at the point of being worth a paid subscription. It needs more organizational tools, an easier way to repeat tasks daily/weekly/monthly, as well as a timeframe for each task (not for notifications, but for organization). Also, when getting events from the calendar it should only grab current or future events to reduce the clutter.	0
awesome, I`m looking at sourcing some as well.	1

I used to depend on this app to basically run my life, until I installed the latest (as of Mar 19) update. Now it doesn't sync properly with my smartwatch -- ticking tasks off on my watch no longer marks them complete on my phone. Also, the widget is broken now, and doesn't reflect changes I've made unless I restart my phone. I sent a support request to the help team, but have gotten total radio silence. If they don't fix it, I'm cancelling my subscription. Right now it's not worth paying for.	-1

You should put in the description that the widgets, monthly, weekly, and even daily calanders are for premium users, that's the main reason why I downloaded. If you don't have the money for a subscription its just a checklist, which can be done on most defualt phone calander apps.	0

My review might be a little skewed because I'm looking for something specific. I want an app to create an hourly task today, that doesn't require me to enter in a reminder for every hour in the day.

Really I just want a flexible natural language reminder app.	0

Todoist has been a big help for me getting organized and I love using it. Unfortunately I can only give it three starts due to a problem I've been having for months now. Long story short, my weekly streak doesn't reset when I fail to meet my weekly goal. I've contacted their customer support team twice since the problem started and both times I was told they were checking with the dev team followed by silence. No explanation or solution.	0
It depends on your goals & how much you want to spend Cannondale, Specialized and Cervelo are all good brands.	1
I like this app quite a bit. It has more useful features compared to the normal Samsung calendar app. It does not, however, play well with Google. In that I can't ask Google what my agenda is and have it pull info from this app. Lame. Hence 4 stars only. Not sure if that's a Google thing or a thing for this app. Otherwise I like it a lot.	1

I purchased the paid version and I'm sort of disappointed. Every time I enter a task it adds the first letter of the first word over again so I have to change it each time (i.e. it will autocorrect to EEvery instead of Every). It is also kind of laggy. It could be a great app, but not as is.	0

Just started using the app and it doesn't scale with my phone's zoom settings so the icons on the bottom are cut off. Is there a way to fix this? It doesn't seem to have its own zoom options. More accessibility features would be great (e.g. zoom, contrast, dexterity settings). Also it's great to see a wheelchair available for the avatar but it would be more inclusive and fun for more users if there were more types of default assistive devices (canes, walkers, crutches, braces, glasses, etc).	1

For the Samsung Note 9 newest OS update. Customer service FINALLY figured out the problem. And it worked for about a month. Then Samsung sent out a new OS & the reminders are firing even more randomly than before. Just emailed tech support AGAIN. I have to say, I do love the app & tech support is good, but response time is slow. But unless developers can find away to keep it working no matter what update the phone developers come up with, I may have to find a more Google friendly app.	-1

"Excellent app!! I use it every day. I've got a few small requests though, if possible! Another app I tried had the option to drag & drop timelines to reschedule times, e.g. make things a little shorter or longer. It's not an absolute necessity, but I find it a little clunky having to edit each event in turn, although I do love the ""add this gap to previous/next activity"" option. Also, not a necessity but would be a nice touch - I'd love to be able to reorder my routines. Couldn't figure out why they were all in a funny order, but it arranges them alphabetically, and since I make a routine for each day of the week, they were all very jumbled up. I've solved it for now by adding numbers to the start of each name, but again, just slightly clunky. As for the rest, I absolutely adore it. Love the persistent notification; each time I pick my phone up absentmindedly to check my notifications, I see what I'm meant to be doing, and it gets me back on track. Thank you!!"	1

List feature sucks! I don't need to manage myself so I can't speak to that functionality. I just wanted a list app, preferably one that worked with Google Assistant. Although that feature works great, the list feature kind of sucks. In an attempt to look new and edgy, the user experience went down the drain. I found it clunky & irritating. I shouldn't have to add a new item to the grocery list just to be able to uncheck items I need again. And that's just one of many irritations. AnyList baby!	-1
It is not an exaggeration to say that the colorful, customizable, syncable, endlessly-useful TickTick has changed my workflow, productivity, & life. There are some improvements I've hoped they'd make -- the ability to determine an est. amt of time for a task (aside from Pomodoro/calendar); including a habit tracker in the computer software in addition to the phone -- but it's 5 stars even with those elements lacking, and that's why I am a loyal customer who has recommended it to everyone I know.	1

love the idea! but the execution is kind of clumsy. there's little to no guidance with regard to how parties or challenges work, and the rewards seem to be random at best. the graphics are adorable and the app definitely has potential though! but it would be more user friendly to streamline the app because it can be overwhelming with so many choices and options (i.e. mounts, food, eggs, etc) that seem mostly arbitrary.	1

It's a delightful app that helps you keep on top of things. Personally, I've found that you get as much as you put into it. There are communities and challenges you can join with like-minded people to help you achieve similar goals, and their are seasonal events as well. There are no adds, no constant pop ups to buy gems, and all features are equally helpful without the gems.	1

Update 2/19/2020: I cant recommend this app to anyone. The smart date parsing only works reliably if you enter it using military time. Also the fact that you have to enable alarm mode to have reminders fire on time is ridiculous. I have many apps that push notifications on time and don't require that. So the developers don't know how to do reminders correctly. Horrible app.	-1

"Overall, the app does what it's supposed to do, but a few quality of life features would go a long way - for one, a list for ""later this week"" would be nice, as would the ability to nest lists more than one deep. However, the Achilles' heel of the system is definitely its sync. Syncing frequently fails or takes forever, and is often too slow between devices to make the most of the other capabilities of the app. Honestly if a better option came out I'd jump ship in a heartbeat."	0

I just tried this app and I am already compelled to buy the premium version.

Great app but why do you need 13 Ad trackers in this paid for pro app? Exodus privacy list 13 trackers against your app which is rediculous. Using this every day, but now concerned my every move is being tracked 13 times. Edit: You inform, so that makes it okay then, for you. Perhaps other more privacy focussed users should look elsewhere. How do I confirm the trackers are not used? Trust you, I bet.... 13 are for revenue, 1 will suffice for personalising.	-1

I love using forest as a timer when I study, however there is the ethical issue that you can't plant real trees unless you have premium. This really frustrates me because they took an opportunity to help the environment and turned it into an opportunity to make money. I understand that they need the money from buying premium to plant the trees, but it feels like they are making people feel guilty in order to sell premium to them. Thank you for the response, I appreciate you taking the time.	0

"Well, like anything this app is only as useful as you're willing to let it be. BUT, if you are committed to either making or breaking (or both!) any habit you can think of, then this little jewel of an app can help you do that. The idea of ""streaks"" may seem trivial to some, but we all crave this at some level because it clearly marks out your accomplishments in a tangible way. When you see you have X days of success, you are that much more likely to overcome the impediments you may face. What's more, this program is highly flexible in the ways you can track any given habit. I have yet to find a habit and pattern I couldn't set up. The app is free, although I paid for the premium version because 1) I HATE ads and 2) I liked the flexibility of data export, so just try it and you may find that it changes your life for the better."	1

Decent app, but would be so much better if you could set the worth of your tasks. Some tasks are simple, like 'drink more water', others like 'save $2000'. Theres nothing but a crude difficulty rating to differentiate tasks. We cam create rewards and their worth, why wouldnt we have control of the amount of points for the tasks??	0

Just downloaded the app and noticed that I cant have 2 events overlapping eachother? My example is to be in the office (for my job) and do schoolwork. But i categorize these as two different events and want to be able to see them as such, so I know everything I am doing. Please add this!	1

The reward system is amazing and I can wait to unlock more plants as i progress. As a nature lover, I live for the idea of helping out the REAL life environment aswell, which is an amazing feature of this app. The only down side is that it sometimes crashes, which is frustrating but I can get past that.	1

Tasks helps me stay organized but I still want some option to be in it like if I want to copy a task from a list to another I should duplicate it in the the same list and then move it to the other list .

UPDATE: changed to 5 stars due to the price changes in the store. The pop up ads are still a little annoying but it's still not too much of q problem. I love the variety in plants you can buy! It's a really cute app. Occasionally an ad would pop up outta nowhere but it's not too much of a problem. I think it'd be nice for the bushes to cost lower than the trees, due to them not needing as much time off to grow, but that's just my opinion. 😊	1

I liked this app, even paid for it, but uninstalled it today due to weird behavior. I see two other reviews here with a similar problem. The app will periodically launch itself, but it's just a black screen, and it creates a copy of my home screen - looks the same but frozen until I hit the close button, then the copy scrolls away and I can again use my phone. Just odd.	-1

The widget in one line mode could shorten the time spans so they don't take as much space. Also it doesn't seem to sync well between multiple phones with tasks. *10/22/2018 edit* Not sure how else to respond to the dev but it's task syncing not calendar syncing that's the issue. *10/23/2018 edit* both devices have task syncs active, and are just the main google account	0

This is quite frankly the best to-do app I've ever used. It has features I didn't even know I needed, like searching for tasks, or the my day tasks list. It syncs really well and worked even better than I'd hoped. Great Job.	1
It was okay but when I tried to set a reminder for 15 minutes from now it said reminders set in the past will not show. That is extremely inconvenient and annoying . I tried setting it for 15 minutes from now but didn't work. Would have given five stars if it wasn't for this issue	-1

Absolutely love this app. 4 out of 5 for two reasons. One, navigation, I think swiping between habits rather than scrolling would be a better interphase and also more intuitive. Scrolling habits only goes one direction, swiping could go both, as long as you're off the calendar. Two, the free version only can track five habits. I'll probably buy the app for full access, because this truly is a good app. However just a few more, say 10 instead of 5 in the free version would've been appreciated.	1

"Way worse than Wunderlist. They overcomplicated the interface and they got rid of the ability to type things such as ""get groceries tomorrow"" and have it automatically detect the due date. Nice job..."	-1
I loved this app for a long time, however since an update early in the year the app keeps killing my tree randomly part way through the timer despite me not unlocking or sometimes even touching my phone. I contacted the dev and gave it 6 months in hopes it would be resolved, but unfortunately it looks like this app isn't for me anymore. I hope it works better on your phone! When it works it's great!	-1

well, thanks for the app and the nice touches and effort that've been put in it. However, there are other simple things you can adjust: - adding colors options for every habit - making marking with color scheme and check marks at the same time - making an access on laptop - when I put measurable habit he ask me about the account twice!! Idw what is for? I know you want to keep the app with beautiful simplicity, which is great, but you should offer more options for those who wants more	1

All it needs is Google Calendar integration. Edit: Oh wait it does have it! I was using the Any.do Chrome Extension (the little pop out thing) when writing this review. The Any.do Chrome Extension does not have the ability to display Google Calendar events alongside one's Any.do tasks whereas the Any.do Android app does indeed have it. AFAIK. It doesn't have IFTTT applets but I'd return if it made some.	1

I really like this app and find it useful for keeping me on track. Simple but effective. I used the free version for almost 2 years. At the end of the first year it reset and I lost all of my history. So before the end of the second year I bought the premium version and promptly lost all of my history again. I contacted support to see if they could help and got no response at all. I still recommend it for tracking your habits but don't expect to keep the info long term or get help if you need it	0

I've been using this app for some weeks now. There are still some features that I don't understand and there's just so much available for customisation that it's overwhelming. But, once i spent a few hours customizing all i wanted, this app has been so fun and useful. Most to do list apps out there are so cumbersome and anxiety inducing. This one isn't. It has helped me prioritize what's important to me while letting me role-play. I like it a lot.	1

Looking as everyone else's very +ve reviews. I seem to be the odd one out but I didn't find it straightforward. It is too easy to delete a list (on my S9 at least) with even a slight bit of a swipe. Once deleted it is lost. Why not have a 'back' or 'undo' button? Personally I don't find the heading, group, list structure particularly straightforward although I've now got used to it.	-1

By far the most streamlined and easy way to keep my tasks organized and clean, all in one place! I love the compatibility with Google Calendar. It's so simple and not as complicated as some other reminder apps. It just works.	1
Perfect except for one thing. The 'I want to...' button at the bottom of my to do list sometimes blocks the bottom item on my list, making it more difficult to cross off. There is already an add item button on each list category, so I think it should be removed or users should be given an option to remove it.	1

I've been using this app since the beginning of December and it has really helped me with keeping on track with tasks and developing habits. However, there are a few issues with the party features. When a message is sent in the chat, no one is notified and we cannot respond appropriately unless we actively check. The chat and members tab also tends to not load up and I have to leave the app in order for it to work again. Navigating the app is also quite a hassle but it isn't a major issue.	1

Simple and intuitive. I don't even know for sure how long I've been using TickTick, but at the time I tried multiple free to-do list apps, and this one was by far my favorite.

Guys - I really want to like this app more and give it 5 stars! Everything is there and I can see the work and effort that has gone into making it so thank you so much! But on Android the habits screen is quite buggy and won't let me adjust the streaks. The keyboard comes up but closes immediately so I can't do anything. The dailies work fine. I look forward to any updates you're planning but considering this is free, I think what you've achieved is great!	1

I've been enjoying the app. I love how I can easily set recurring tasks. There's just one thing I wish I could change. I wish I could change the hour at which a new day begins. I know that sounds weird, but I am a night owl and usually don't go to bed until after midnight. Before I settle down for the night, I like to review my day and check off tasks that I forgot to check off earlier. But by the time I do that, it is technically a new day and the tasks are automatically marked overdue.	1

Great app, but whin i installed it and tried the basic feature which is the reminder, it doesn't avaliable thats mean you cant also try the reminder.

I'd have to open one list and copy the text then open the other list and paste..."	-1

I think the app is very good, has helped me to keep track of my habits. However I wish there was a function whereby you could postpone a habit for something out of your control i.e. not going to the gym because you're on holiday. This although a break from the habit doesn't feel like it should affect the moments when you are focused and in control of keeping the habit. Also how is the success percentage measured if you only have to do the habit a certain number of times a week?	0

Very good... Excellent features. Especially for the subtask, the option to add step for achieving the task/subtask. Kindly add a calendar feature to get an overview of what is ahead. Also, some ready made quick reminders like a call, payment, email, a template for grocery, etc would add cheery to the cake	1

All right so to be clear, this app is amazing and I'm really happy to see that someone has made their own version of it! Even though it's such a great program, it became unusable at day one. It had bugs and limitations that hindered what I was attempting to accomplish. Problems such as: inaccurate characteristics, no quick access from rewards to inventory, non removable default achievements, inaccurate values on skills after undoing a task and hidden xp multiplier from skills to characteristics.	-1

This is a really smart way to keep you off your phone and motivated to work. And I would love to use this app all day everyday but it needs a pause button desperately. Life is full of things that pop up out the blue and in its current state you loose all progress or get rewarded for doing nothing. Please, please, please add an optional pause button. There are already a bunch of optional thing to tweak it please add this. I would go Pro in a heart beat and it would become my top app.	-1

Hides too much behind the subscription. The day views are an example of this. You'll need to pay each month for the ability to see your data displayed in month, week, 3 day, etc. The app feels broken with all of buttons you can press that nag you to pay monthly for features that should only be paid for once. The features that aren't locked behind the subscription can be found in other to do apps. I tried this app and ended up choosing a different one.	-1
It was so good and then the PC version became extremely annoying overnight. I'll add tasks in a project, the app will sync and move the task to an entirely unrelated project on its own. And sure, I can reassign it, but I didn't have to before and that's just an annoying waste of time. I don't mind waiting for it to get fixed, but I might just start looking for a new app, which sucks because I really liked this one.	-1

*Edit* (2.1.2020) : One problem to note is that there doesn't seem to be an easy way to renew overdue tasks. By which I mean in other apps I can usually refresh them all with one click so that the tasks are due today. Would love an option for that, since otherwise I have to go into each task and set it to be due today. TT^TT"	1
() oh snap	0
I love this app, it keeps me organized and is simple to use. It has a lot of features in the free version but isnt too complicated. Some apps try to do too much, not this one, it does what I need and it does it well. I love the feature to make lists or schedule tasks, set a tasks priority, or quickly move it to tomorrow when I've over scheduled myself. Highly recommend.	1
I dont get it in google callender i set a goal to run 4:30 every morning but why on earth is it so that the app sets time on its own and when i edit it it is edited only for one day not the others	-1
You have to pay to pay monthly sync across devices, it should be a one time cost. Edit - You know what streve, I was greedy, everthing else is free. but interdevice sync is a standard in most apps, so the lack of the option is a real down side and now I have to switch app, and it's not that I'm not willing to pay. I just want it to be a one time cost and I still won't pay the price for your years subscription even if it was for a lifetime of use. So I'll give you 4 stars but leave the app.	1

Make sure your phone settings are allowing the app to make notifications.The app works great, and is super helpful. The only thing I would recommend is to be able to make custom categories. Right now you can do other, but can't specify. Would definitely recommend app. Update 2- I can't seem to find the setting that lets me see the notifications. I can get it to work but only once then it stops. Would you be able to help me out? After my first review you said you'd be able to if I needed it.	1

Great way to manage your tasks. Only downside is you set the deadlines and can knowingly chance them at any time	1

Tasks that repeat more than once daily dont work, if you have something that is twice a day you have to have two separate tasks. If you leave a task pending until the following day and complete it, it will never work again.	-1

This is one of the better todo list apps and integrates with events nicely. It is severely let down by poor synchronisation with Google tasks (too slow or forget it) which limits its usefulness where syncing with other applications is a concern. Others sync much more effectively.	0

I love this app, but why does the timer not seem to support landscape mode? Give stars otherwise 💪	-1
We need an update!! I love this app and use it daily but the fact that we haven't had an update in months bothers me. Here are some suggestions I have: add a settings option to default the amount of time you spend on a task (I use 45 min.), more color options for tasks, an option to change the notification sounds for each entry, a 'push all back an hour' option, and more widget options! Thank you I love this app but we could definitely use some upgrades!	0

Complete dumpster for here! Migrating from Wonderlist... We sync between two phones. The list did not completely sync, you have to share each list seperatly, updates to a list did not sync, the app keeps telling me things are being checked and unchecked, I left the shared list and tried to rejoin and it would not rejoin. Microsoft ruined a great simple app. Look elsewhere until this is fixed.	-1

I've been using rhis app for a few weeks. I have a Pixel 2 XL. Pros: Great app. User friendly. Easy to use & group tasks. I love that you can rearrange tasks bases on your preference. Im an entrepreneur with many projecrs and it def keeps me on track. Cons: I wish it could track the amount of time I spend on each major task & sub task, like a time clock. Is this a possibility in Q1 or Q2 of 2020?	1

Almost what i need, except there's no option to set a start & end time with reminder for the start. So it's useless (for me).	-1
It needs a better way to Schedule the to do list. An easy way to schedule your day, week and even month. It needs a calendar to see things with a bird eye view. I like the game thing, but it needs more functions and to be more practical.	0

NOBODY USE THIS APP. Read all the forums. The app does not support the sync once you've bought premium. Everyone's saying the same. And the devs DO NOT RESPOND TO HELP REQUESTS. I have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly I am connected to the internet. I am a premium user. The app is great but please help me with my problem. I'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error.	-1

I immediately encountered a problem when I began, by misclicking on one of my Habits. There's no way to correct for that. Manually change the values, yes, but the xp and hp don't change to reflect that automatically. Secondly, the settings page is broken on my S9, and the issue is difficult to describe. The display freezes so if you scroll, an instance of the text moves while the another is stuck below. Honestly the tutorial really needs work. I could go on but space constraints.	-1

I'm not able to sync events I add in this calendar with my Google calendar, even though I specifically pick the Google calendar every time I add a event. Also I'm not getting any notifications prior to events, you have to manually add reminders for each event, you just can't set a setting to be reminded X minutes before any event. Turns out you need to have your phone default calendar enabled to sync your events and to get notifications from this app.	0
I love this app and the widgets are awesome. 1 star lost because I am frequently getting pop ups (about 5 a day) stating it stopped and to restart app. And there is no update available. I might uninstall if this continues and it gets on my nerves. For now, works for what I need it for.	1

This app really helps me stay mindful of my daily goals. Being able to visualize my progress helps me to decide where to put more focus and what to prioritize each day. It's highly motivating for me personally to be able to tick off the goals I've met, and creates a great sense of satisfaction when I've achieved them. I highly recommend this app to anyone who could use a little help staying on top of daily tasks and accomplishing daily or weekly goals.	1
A today button would be helpful in the week view widget, so that you don't have to scroll back. And also the possibility to add more accounts. Are these features available in the pro version? Maybe the possibility to try it for a short period of time...	1

I like the overall app. It is the best. But even after setting the reminder for my habits. I do not receive any notification or reminder. I have checked with my notification settings for this app and it is turned on.	-1

"I LOVE this app. It's perfect for making a variety of different lists and tasks and ""to dos"". I like how simple and straight forward it is and how you can easily colour coordinate or specify each task with labels and reminders. The only reason why its not a 5 star is because it would be very great to have a grocery shopping specific list you could create that had the option to order foods in different food groups or store categories ie dairy, veggies, meats etc. Thank you!"	1

I totally recommend this app. It had help me on every possible way. It's really helpful if you really want to develop a new habit. I specialy like the easyness to configure the habits and the reminders; the motivational notes that you can find around are just right. But its true that is not a magic app, PLEASE if you want to create a new habit, you have to work for it, you have to work to create something. If you do that, you'll see the true colors of this magnificent app. Be true to yourself.	1

Full of promise but the lack of word wrapping means task detail is hidden. Particularly bad for sub tasks where the font is also larger and therefore exacerbates the issue. If and when this is resolved I'll be able to use the app and give a more balanced appraisal.	0

The app is pretty good, but I wish there was a way to put weekly tasks in. I tried setting up a task that would go off weekly but I still lost health for not completing it daily. It would be nice to be able to put repeating tasks on the app that you don't do every day, but repeat on a schedule, like laundry every Sunday or something.	0

After 6 years of using Wunderlist the day has come to look for a new to-do app. Microsoft To-Do is missing the most important feature of WL, i. e. placing newly addly added and favourite items to the top of the to-do list; practically, the app is useless if you have long lists with floating items. I have sent them this feedback 6 months ago and they still did not change anything about this.	-1

I use it for keeping track of tasks after I complete them. I don't want a reminder of a task,I just need to keep track of it. This app allows me to disable reminders. Keeping track of them is as easy as checking off the day. It has the days circled based on how you schedule your tasks. The user experience is really easy. You can create multiple tasks (or habits to be), schedule them separately and keep track of them on one home page. It shows you stats etc to see your progress. Those for whom the reminders cause unnecessary stress (i.e. workout reminders), this app is better than calendar scheduling.	1

I have been using Artful Agenda on a desktop this year and love all it's features. Now the app makes it even more accessible. I love planning meals and mapping out my day!	1
Very good app for focus, has helped me on more than one occasion. I will say though, the audio it plays, if you choose to play it, sometimes glitches out on my Galaxy S9. It will sometimes just shut off and refuse to play even when my volume is on and the sound option is on. Otherwise though, its a very good focus app, great for people like me who get easily distracted by their phones.	1
I dislike the new update. Now when I have to update the time and date of a task, editing and adding text doesn't work anymore. I need to actually select things from the menu to change those things, or even add a label. The older interface was so much better that let me deal with everything by typing it out.	-1

Not a fan - liked the idea of diving into main areas and percentage of your day it occupates but what flipped me up was scheduling a reminder - daily.

Syncing doesn't work. That was the whole point of upgrading to the Pro version. I log most of my time in the Firefox browser plugin, and it never shows up in the app. I also lost my account. My account wasn't authenticating, so I logged out. When I tried to log back in, it didn't recognize my email (even using Forgot Password). I ended up creating a new account with the same email I know I used before, losing all of my coins. You guys should look into any backend issues with syncing and accounts. Thanks.	-1

I like it, a lot and also not a lot. I like the way it looks once the tasks are created, but I dislike creating the tasks using the current interface. 4 comments. 1. I have the full version with WhatsApp linked and it causes duplicate reminders. 2. The widgets are not recognized by my homescreen replacement app (go launcher). 3. I would like to be able to resize the fonts and spacing. 4. Creating tasks via WhatsApp or Google assistant is very limited in its possibilities and often erroneous.	0

I didn't get enough time in the app to figure out if it was worth it to pay for the full version but now the mandatory ads are a deal breaker.	0

App did not properly import all data from Wunderlist as Microsoft claimed it would. All of my 'created dates' for items in my list got wiped amd set to the current month day and year of when I did the import a couple days ago. This would seem to be a simple table record to grab from the Wunderlist database, to transfer over to To Do. I would expect a cleaner and better QA'd experience from a company like Microsoft. This is as of build #151.	0

I really liked the app, but couldn't find a way to integrate it with my google tasks, which is a most for me.

I did the free trial. This planner does NOT have push notifications. You can set up your events and appointments, even make them reoccurring, but Artful Agenda App will NOT remind you or notify you.

"2018-11-19 -it seems useful, but it crashes on my phone 3 - 15 times a day. 2019-04-13 - No update, this app would be great if it didn't crash just about every time I go to my home screen from *anywhere*. Also there have been no update, and no responses to the roughly 75 - 100 error logs that I have submitted. I paid $5.00 (US) for a ""life time subscription"" to the premium version. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY !!!!!!"	-1

It's decent but the Google tasks integration is bad. It's set to hourly sync but doesn't actually update tasks unless I manually trigger it.

I'm also having a problem with notifications appearing later than they should. All in all, I'm going back to Google calendar.	0

Hi, im using the paid one on my phone and ipad. However i find that they do not sync well on both. Like i already marked 3cups of water on my phone, then whem i open on ipad it's not marked.

It's motivating, but pro mode is a disappointment. Now rather than being able to watch an ad for double coins at the end of a session I earn the same base coins with the option to pay real money for increased coin earning. I already paid for pro mode! And pro mode feels entirely necessary for the white listing feature. Without it even apps like a music player or calculator, that are sometimes required to be used while you are focusing, will kill your tree. I feel ripped off.	-1

I have used the app for many years and loved it. Within the last several months, it no longer syncs seamlessly with my Google calendar. Specifically, organizing tasks has become very gitchy. If you are looking for a calendar app and don't mind it not syncing with your Google calendar on your desktop then it's a great app. Unfortunately I'd really like it to sync.	1

So far it's a nice, simple app that makes it easy to organise tasks. I am a fan if the widget to let me see different lists, BUT when I switch lists, it often unchecks what has already been done which kind of defeats the purpose. If this could be fixed I would increase the rating.	0

I like this app alot. It lets me track my habits and goals in an intuitive way. Only would ask a few minor things, like a line on the bar chart that shows the limit/goal & task alarms even when app not active.	1
Nawww, sorry your yearly subscription price scared me off. By the time I've subscribed to every app I consider helpful I'm spending waaay too much. I would have liked it but I have other much more important bills to pay. The low stars is due to the price and there's no point in coming back to justify it because it'll still be too much for me. Edit: I know that I can use it for free, but then I'd still have to put up with ads. Surprisingly I don't like ads. I still consider your sub too much.	-1

Would be perfect if: - You could update cloned activities, meaning if you changed one all of them would change too - You could check off the activities like a to do list (it works as a reward system) - You could scroll up in your timetable to see what you did that day/things you missed because it only shows everything from that point in time forwards. Otherwise really love the design and layout, and it makes me super organised.	1

I never give reviews. I believe in if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it. My issue is not with the app itself, its the fact that I have been charge every single month for over a year!

One of the best apps I ever liked. But I can't control my anger right now. If there is a limitation of 5 real trees then why didn't you mention it on purchase page????? Why nowhere you have mentioned that we can plant only 5 trees maximum. If you are going to plant only 5 trees with the money we paid, cant we use the same money to plant 5 in my neighbourhood? Worst app ever now. False marketing by hiding about 5 tree limit Update: I understand. But MENTION ABOUT THE 5 TREE LIMIT ON PURCHASE PAGE	-1

Nice app if you have tons of calendars from different accounts and still want to be able to see a selected subset of them. A bit annoying with the pro version advertisement as of recently.

"It's a great app and has definitely helped me maintain my habits. I had been gifted premium early on, but I've found that the features have disappeared and I'm only seeing the base version. I like it enough that I want to buy it, but I worry about whether it will keep the features based on my experience and other reviews. I've also found a bug: when I have a goal set to 3x a week as ""success,"" the app doesn't recognize when I've had a successful streak and always shows as 0 successes in the streak section, whereas it's at 80% in the ""percent success"" section and many weeks of meeting my goal."	0

It's honestly very useful when studying or working by myself. It keeps me accountable for how much work I get done.

Looking at the features and lots of accolades I tried uninstalled after just a trial. Reason: In the free version notification feature is missing.

Came highly recommended. Tried it. HATE that I can't see the subtasks in a project(why even..), and apparently that's a recent update! Well no one seems to like this feature, or at least there should be an option to either have subtasks or not, so hope you guys bring it back. Will use it then. Another observation- most of the top-notch features are unavailable to non-Premium users, and not many are willing to subscribe. Seems a bit unfair. One time payment would be great. Will that change?	0

LOVE this app - but I have two suggestions to make the habit function even better. Possible to implement please? 1) Interval tracking - e.g. do a habit every third day. Resets to third day following every time the habit is marked as done. 2) Track a habit less frequently than once per week e.g. once every two months. Will subscribe if the app has these two abilities!	1

Still a great app though coming from wunderlist I don't understand the crappy import. In wunderlist you add new tasks at the top of the list. In todo at the bottom. Yet it imports the list as if it was wunderlist. So all your lists will get new items added in todo at the bottom, where you had your oldest entries in wunderlist. All lists are basically inverted.	1

"It's a good app. It's pretty, minimalist and works really well. It just really bothers me that the ""undo"" (button that appears when you make a change) gets in the way of adding a new task and gets accidentally clicked, so I have to wait for it to go away. I would suggest for the developers to please take a look and see if you can adjust the placement of the buttons in this case. Thanks!"	1
Just changed phone. Didn't keep anything from my Premium account. Can't even create a new account without erasing current data... -2* for that inconvenience /// Has helped me tremendously develop new habits. UI is perfect! The app and widgets allow quick and easy habit tracking. Counting habits are useful, but it would be great to be able to see near misses in order to track improvement better. Customization of the interval chosen to calculate percentages would be very helpful.	0

I needed a replacement for Wunderlist, which we relied on for task lists for our business & employees. With TickTick, I had to manually type in each task for each list because the Import feature only put them in my Inbox. There's no Home Screen - hitting the return arrow exits the app (not a biggie, just an adjustment). The real downer is having to pay to share the lists with more than one person. Collaboration was an important feature we needed. Using Microsoft's To Do for now.	0

I used to love this app. It worked flawlessly for me and it was my go-to calendar app. However, recently I am having trouble where it does not sync anything other than my single Outlook calendar, with my other calendars being visible from my phone, but not having the events also populate on my laptop. This is a huge problem for me and definitely a deal breaker. If this can't be resolved I'll have to start looking elsewhere for a calendar. It still is a nice calendar app, but if you want seemless integration between your phone and your laptop, look elsewhere.	-1

--Update 2--: Okay, I think I have figured it out. The app doesn't sync with the servers on my WiFi, but works fine on my Data connection. Weirdly enough, the web version works on my laptop using the same WiFi. Please fix. --Update 1--: Reinstalled app. Apparently login with Google is completely broken. Not working at all.

A great app. I just downloaded it and I already love it. The only issue here is slight ui bugs. November 2017 gets covered up by the tabs at the top and on the day section the date runs into the calender layout. Again great app but those errors make the app look less professional. I would recommend rescaling the fragments so they fit better on the page as well as the toolbar. Definitely am recommending to friends though	1

This app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned LifeRPG app and from a bit of digging so far I'm impressed. Some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so I'll probably bite on that once I've set up everything and used the app a bit. One suggestion I'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events - like bringing up a reminder when I'm near the gym or store.	1
Please make an google account login, tired of Microsoft auth shenanigans.	0
I was using this app just fine without problems for about 2 months but when my wife decided to get us both a subscription, my account stopped working right.

Its been about a week and i have yet to hear again from technical support.	-1

Brilliant app for older versions of Android. This app have helped me keep track of my tasks at work and personal very effectively for years. It is very easy to use. I have upgraded to Android Oreo, and reminder pop up stopped for my tasks. Contacted support, but they couldn't figure out how to fix. I appreciate they tried their best. I've migrated to Splendo as a stop gap arrangement till I find a better app as good as any.do. 2 * given, as this app is working just as a notepad to me to list tasks, but I don't get any form of reminders.	-1

the last update is great. but I find the search function needs to improve, I prefer like the old BCPro, or like the samsung stock calendar.

I wanted an app that would allow me to create grocery lists from web/desktop but access them from mobile. At the time of writing, this functionality still isn't fully working. Grocery lists are categorized on mobile, but the web version just shows a single list with all items mixed together. Auto-categorization has been working on mobile since 2018, but the developers still have not bothered to port this important feature to desktop. Also, I feel that far too many of the options are locked down for premium users, even trivial options like background colors.	0

"Really helpful app. I've looked at lots of other schedule apps, but this one is the easiest for me to customize precisely. Great for making routines! Since a few of my routines overlap, it would be amazing if there were an option to see routine titles in the widget timeline above or before the task, in order to keep an overview of which/whose routine is in effect. Both of my children have their own different weekly routines, so it would be nice to see on the timeline, that for example, it's kid#1 who has school on Monday mornings and kid#2 on Monday afternoon instead of two ""time for school"" tasks with no specifics. It would also be great if this app could be accessible from my computer desktop or if I could sync with other family members."	1

ok, but feels like untested alpha state software. tricky to navigate quickly when called from a widget, direct call entry for phone calls seems to be missing (though that's the first thing one needs in a todo list), sorting tasks is either impossible or a well hidden feature, sharing and assigning is very rudimentary.	0

"simple app, widget is bad (left side has a bar that ruins symmetry, also you cant remove the new task button), also, why can I change list color but cant change button color? would also be cool to preview what ""compact/cozy"" and whatnot settings do instead of having to select them one by one, leave settings, and go back in to change them again. all in all, its almost a 5 star app, but the nuissances ruin the experience a bit."	-1

I have only had this app for a few days. The more I search for solutions the more I find. This is a great app, but it needs a way to give each task a sortable priority number. I love the My Day page which gives me the most important subset of all my tasks. I never put more than 5 things there. If I complete them before the end of the day, I add more. One of my favorite features is the ability to hide completed tasks. The biggest fault is I haven't found a tutorial for all the features.	1

Wunderlist is way better and simpler. Why is this so complicated??? I dont need another complicated app to update that is hard to read. Just copy wunderlist exactly. I dont need 4 categories (my day, tasks, etc.). All I want is one area to see all things due today or overdue not a bunch of extra list to sort through.	-1

This app is good and it's useful. Yes it's true that it has a few bugs here and there but the app itself is good and I like it. I wish it had an offline mode because I can't stay on all the time but I can see why we need to be online at all times.	1
Thanks Synn!	1

Update: Used to be great. Now they've added so many steps it's no longer the simple app it used to be. Very disappointed.	-1
This app has been great for me, especially to track daily goals I set for myself. it shows me the days I have succeeded, and the days Ive fallen short. I can see a history of my success and setup reminders to make sure I don't miss a daily goal. I've been using the app for a little over a month now and highly recommend it to anyone who has daily goals they want to rack and be successful with!	1

The app itself is pretty good. My issue came from having difficulties canceling my subscription. I described everything I was doing to try to do it, what I was seeing instead of the option to unsubscribe, etc. The solution suggested did not help, so I described the situation further. The next response came from a different person, who suggested a method I had already mentioned was not working for me. After I replied again, I never got another response. I just figured out what the issue was, but I couldn't do so before getting charged again. Disappointed in the customer service.	0

Can't adjust center clock size. Can't open alarms by touching the center clock. The image for opening the app on the play store doesn't represent what you can customize the clock to look like as a widget. Augh. Cool but lacking necessary functions. EDIT - I was not able to click the center clock and open my alarms. Not sure why. But the developer said it is possible.	-1
This is unforgivably close to perfect. Why no timer? So many tasks are long-term and need to be chipped away at bit by bit. You could have it where once a task was selected, the timer would start, and you would earn a certain amount of experience and coin for every x amount of minutes completed. As it is, I have two pair this app with a different promodo app.	0

Then, when I exit the app and go back to it, it's the default character and I cannot customise it/my account.	-1

Awful UX/UI - I don't like how you have to use a rigid syntax to set recurrence for tasks. I like old fashioned controls, but Todoist is just trying to be different for no reason. Was on Premium for several months and gave it a fair shot - needless to say, I cancelled my subscription and switched to TickTick instead. I don't normally downvote apps, but this just didn't do it for me, and I spent money on it. I should have ignored the hype, so the fault is mine.	-1

The app is allready great. The amount of customisation is surreal and with a bit of tweaking you can really make it work. The sentimental value you create this way really helped me grow. As the app is rpg themed, those elements could be further enhanced imo. I think a customisable character would be fun. More options to spend the currency other then personalised awards is what im getting at. This way you really build something with the effort you've put in. For the games.. Keep up the good work	1

I like the ideas of the app. However the biggest inconvience for me is when something happens that disrupts my routines. There doesn't seem to be anyway to change the routine for one day with out changing it for every day in the futurs as well. It is annoying to have to manualy change a routine and then have to change it back the next day. I would like to see an option to edit or rearrage single intances of items in the time line without effecting the base routine or future dates.	0

Please, make the widget minimalistic/customizable/half-transoerent like in com.stuff.todo. What you have now it too cluncky, all-branded and in most cases doesn't fit homescreen aesthetically.

"This is a re-review. This could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smart/auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. Just don't confuse the 'game' in RPG for any actual gameplay; but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. Firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. After a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. While auto-grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them- but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. With no social aspect currently attached to the app (as at ver 2.23.0) there is no task sharing. There is also no designated pc/mac/linux front end for desktop syncing. Finally it's expensive as apps go. A one off of $75 will get the full version, or about $2.50 a month (paid yearly), which removes ads and gives calendar access. Original review: ""A good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. Being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. It would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader."""	0

Easy to use and works seamlessly. It has helped me stay on track with my studies and even to take breaks timely breaks. The incentives are fun and interesting enough to keep me wanting to plant trees. I particularly enjoy labelling the trees as I can then export the data and see how many hours I have been working on different things. It gives me the freedom to write up my own things in python to analyse that data and plan better for the next week.	1

Great app. My only problem is some of my habits I created doesn't work; I set a habit so I don't do something atleast 8 days of the month, but it links all the days inbetween successful days together. I only end up being successful for 6 days out of the month, but then it says 20+ days successful, because it link all the successful days together. Going to try other apps, unless I can resolve this issue.	1

I was looking for an organizer app which would provide statistics on my discipline and progress, and this does it! But it is missing one, to me basic, feature - the tasks don't have a start time or duration period, there is only a deadline. It doesn't allow understanding easily whether the tasks overlap in time. Is this feature available in the premium version at least? Another missing feature is the location setting, at least at a home/work/outdoors level. Any plans to incorporate the features?	1

The new notifications are useless to me. I always keep my phone on vibrate, and the old normal Android notification would vibrate my phone and notify me on my watch too. But now the new notification pops up silently and is very easy to miss. And I've tried changing the settings and nothing works. I really don't understand why not use Android's build-in notifications instead of this new thing or why is there no option to turn it off?	-1

"Checked out this app in my quest to find a good solution for combining calendar events and tasks into a single, scrollable homescreen widget. --- Unfortunately, although the app has the option to repeat a task ""from the completion date,"" the functionality is broken. For example, I scheduled my test task on a Tuesday and set it to repeat every week from the completion date. The app forced there to be a day of the week listed in the repeat schedule, so that it would say something like ""repeat weekly on Thursday on completion date."" --- Now, having a day of the week and also ""from completion date"" makes no sense, so I was curious what the app would do. I set my Tuesday task to repeat every Thursday from completion date and checked it off on a Sunday. The app should have rescheduled the task for the following Sunday, but it didn't. It scheduled it for the following Tuesday and completely ignored the ""Thursday"" and the ""from completion date."" --- Sorry, Business Calendar 2, but that's just not going to work."	-1

Can't add new Tasks to Top of list?? Clearly no one in Microsoft actually use To Do. If you did, you'd know that this is an extremely important and basic feature. Otherwise you add a task and it disappear to the end. I don't believe one can efficiently use a to do list without this feature.	-1

Update: problem fixed. Did you people just do another update? Because the app is completely screwed up. It can't recognize that my phone is connected to the internet.	-1
Worked fab until recently then I noticed the time in the centre was an hour wrong although when I went into the app it had the time right. So I uninstalled and tried to reinstall but when I tried to put the widget on my home screen it now puts on a blank box that's resizable but invisible otherwise! Very disappointed.	-1
Happy Mother`s Day to all mothers out there! I am not one myself, but I have been called something along those lines	1

I migrated to this app a few months ago from Wunderlist which I absolutely loved! Im still getting used to this version and the Microsoft integration as I have been a GSuite user for a few years now. While I love this app I took one star for the MyDay list. I get the developers want you to be more intentional BUT I plan my day the night before so this list is useless to me. And with the due dates not auto loading in it also makes it difficult. Nice thought but does not work for night planners.	1

This is an amazing app, it has helped me focus so much and even has a real world impact, but only if you use pro version. I completely understand the need for a pro version, without it you wouldn't be able to do the things you do with the app, and I wish it wasn't there, but that's not my call to make. It's an amazing app and I highly recommend	1

This is a great app for me. The app is easy to navigate and the motivational quotes are a nice touch. I give this app 4 stars because I have an issue with the notifications. I want the app to remind me to do a certain task a certain amount of times throughout the day, but it only sends me the notification once I open the app which defeats the purpose of the notification. Not sure if I'm the only experiencing this problem? Other than that, I use this app on the daily.	1

I loved this app when I first got it. Though I still find it useful, the app vs desktop functionality leaves something to be desired. Still, I would have given a higher rating if the app didn't have a habit of moving tasks to a random calendar date instead of the one I selected. I'm not sure I'll purchase a second year subscription.	0
satisfactory	0
Buggy as all hell. The advertisement is right. It gamifies tasks... But that's it. No tracking history of your habits. Inaccurate as all hell. Worst of all is you can't delete your account.

"I once rated this app and company a five star. However long, with their recent updates they have utterly failed to test the user experience. All the alerts.settings are changed so you get texts, notifications and emails when you had turn them off.

I like to see companies trying to improve, but if they are this lazy with the user experience who lazy are they with customer data. Lost of all trust here."	-1

So disappointed to lose everything. I didn't realize the app didn't save your lists. Got a new phone and everything transferred but because this app doesn't have you log in, everything is gone. I had several important lists saved to prepare for my upcoming baby and it's all gone. I'll never remember it all. Time to look for something else to use. Response: From the main screen I didn't see any prompting so did not know I was supposed to or how to.	0
I really like the idea of this app but it doesn't function well for me. I'm a musician and I tried using it for practise but I had to use an metronome in the phone and then the tree always dies.

Use this app every day and used to totally love it. But in the last month or so they have allowed full-page video ads to take over the screen. The only way to get rid of them is to force close the app, which I now do repeatedly. Can't continue like this! Totally unacceptable. What the heck could they possibly have been thinking. Downright stupid business decision. Looking hard for another app to replace this one as soon as I can. It was nice while it lasted.	-1

Wish they kept the wunderlist app instead it was perfect 😭!!! Some issues I had with this app compared to Wunderlist to fix: -have new items added to the top instead of adding to the bottom (or have option to change) -more quick choice options for the reminder times -quick add bar (to just type in a search bar box instead of clicking the + button) -have settings apply to all lists so don't have to individually change each list -option to add to list on main screen without clicking in list	-1

Very helpful and useful. I made use of the widget very often, but it stopped working and only started back to work when I uninstalled and then reinstalled the app. Otherwise, this is is a 5-star app.	1
It's really handy for specific dates and categories, but I would love it if there were more customising and theme options that are not for the premium package.	0

Not giving 5 stars because of the following reasons : 1. It's very annoying when you enter into a habit page and you swipe down to scroll down to see stats . But it switches to another habit page. Please fix this . It's counter intuitive. 2. No method to edit the habits online on PC or Mac . Limits the app to smart phones only. Otherwise it's a good app. Does what it is supposed to do.	0

I bought the paid verison. It does help us track the habits with simple yes or no questions and by answering with numbers. But habits aren't as simple as it is... we need other methods to track habits like options to enter time. If I want to develop a habit of waking up by 7.. it shouldn't be a yes or no question... I should be able to enter the time track it over the month.	0

"Thanks for the response. The fact that an event repeats should have nothing to do with the type of notification and I think there should still be a repeating icon if no notification is set.

Really enjoy the app, probably wouldnt recommend unless you have someone to do it with.

This app was exactly what I was looking for. a visual of the day in clock form. Only issue is, if I add something to the clock it adds it to my calendar. I don't want that. I want an app where the calendar and app are separate. This was supposed to be for studying and exercise. I didn't want to have to add those things as into my ready packed calendar. it was a fast uninstall. Iif there was an option to disconnect the two, I'd reinstall.	-1

It's helped me stay on track with habits I want to cultivate. I'm really data driven and thrive on external validation, so I like seeing graphs and the calendar fill up with my successful days. It works well for me. The app itself is good too. It hasn't crashed or done anything unexpected in the week I've used ii find logging mt. The only thing I wish I could do is go back and change what makes a day successful.	1
Dear Team! I've been using this app since ages and I'm mostly satisfied but with Android 10 I lost the pop-up notification feature in the app. How can I restore it? Without pop-up notifications, only 4 stars. 😔 Thanks in advance! Reaction for the developer's comment: Even if I click on the notification in the status bar, it doesn't open pop-up but the event itself. And anyhow, pop-up notification is crucial for me, otherwise I simply miss the notifications from the calendar. Any ETA? 😔	1

The idea is great, however it adds only event to my calendar. I like circle planer idea and that I simply can put work and then event at work and that it reflects on this circle.

Really good app, helps you focus	1
I like this app because it's better than another app I found and is really good at reminding me to stick to schedule. But I gave it four stars because even though I haven't had any issue with this yet, it does have in app purchases wich I don't think are needed here. But overall if you need to plan a day or routine, use this app.	1
I have been using the app from the last 3 years. I am a premium user. When trying to sign in a new device and sync, it's not syncing. I need my data. please help with this issue. Even after reaching to the support team tonnes of times no one is responding. So i am changing the rating from 3 to 1.	-1

I used to like this. Then the updated it to include something called in Inbox which is just ruining it for me. I dont need that its making it confusing to keep track of things. I will be replacing this with another app.	-1
Great app, but it just syncs to my google calendar making it redundant. I wanted to use this for nonpersonal task and keep it separated. While using the App I get 40 notifications because it updates my personal calendar as well. I gave 2 stars because otherwise the functionality and UI is really nice.	-1

Not happy with the switch from Wunderlist. Why did you remove the option to assign a list to a group at the time you are creating a new list? It is cumbersome and time consuming to have to drag the list to a new group, especially when you have numerous groups and lists as I do and I move them often. What a pain!	0

Needs a VPN if you're in China. Some questionable UI and design choices, though the fundamentals work well for the most part. If you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay, of course. And the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate. One month is the same price as a month of Netflix and a year is £47. A year of MS Office 365 with all of its functionality is £60... Let that sink in. I don't understand why, for relatively little, this app costs so much. Greed, I assume.	-1

Pretty good app but nothing crazy that I can't achieve with Google calendars already if there is I'm not in need for the feature atm. I've really been looking for the feature to set a reoccurring remind with a full custom option for say repeat every 43 days or repeat 3 months, then 4 months then 3 then 4 etc this sorts of features would be amazingly handy as you would then not have to set up a new reminder for each date after having worked them out manually. If you add this feature please LMK	0

Liking it a lot so far, but I don't get it doesn't give a warning ring before tasks I put in. That's kind of the main thing I need it for - to remind me of tasks I had previously put in.	1
It's been 1 week since I'm using the app. The reminder system worked fine for 1day and from next day the reminder system stopped functioning. Really disappointed. May be uninstalling the app after few days. Hope this helps.	-1
It`s going to be a fun night and I`m helping host it!!!	1
So it's a good app. Two things: 1. Sometimes I'll get back on after a really long session and my tree will have died for no reason. When I check the button that tells you, it's just a random app that I hadn't opened that day. Its happened several times and it makes me really sad so please fix this. 2. I can't get the app to let me access any other apps. Sometimes I will use it for homework so I don't get side tracked but I can't open a calculator without sacrificing the life of my tree. I wish you could select apps that would be okay to stay on. Please fix these two things and I will give you 5 stars for sure!!!	0

CONVENIENT! COLORFUL! FEATURES AND SETTINGS CATER TO LIST-LOVERS! I've always enjoyed hand writing lists for everything & had zero interest in switching or including tech for list making. I HAD to install 'Tasks' to make a list during an apartment move-in evaluation. To my PAPERLESS surprise, there were more issues than I thought I could recall from memory. Ended up making FOUR lists w/ this app on the 1st day. Now I'm listbidextrous! Got twice as many w/ both written & app made lists!	1

This is by far the best out there but it is not reliable because if i get a new phone for whatever reason the data will not transfer to new phone (data will be lost or i will not have time to set the settings and input previous data in new phone )and that is only reason i cant trust this app. I am very upset that one flaw kills a very good app. Anyone that uses a calender heavily knows the trouble of my example. Again, by far it is a very very good calendar app.	-1

Developer is non-responsive. For some reason when downloading the app from the play store it associates with the incorrect Google account. I have verified I am downloading the app with my intended account, however it continually associates with the wrong account. It's not really a big deal, but I was planning to upgrade to premium with my play store credits. The account this app associates to does not have any.	-1

I liked a lot about this app, but unfortunately, there is no feature to repeat tasks (hourly, daily, weekly, etc), which is kinda vital for me. Without it, I can't recommend this app. Much as I hate Todoist's subscription model, they seem to be the leader as of right now.	0
Never responded to my original review in 2019 and the response to my latest review still doesn't answer the fact that any tasks that are recurring DO NOT show in calendar even though you sync this information.	-1

Checked is again as they are killing Wunderlist: Still lacking so many basic features, really lame. Why can't I manualy change the order of the tasks like in Wunderlist? where are the completed tasks? where are the deleted tasks? why are new items always added to the bottom?	-1

dependant on another calendar app. Why? why do I need to have another app to use this app? I can't add plans or schedule without this app throwing the task to Google Calendar. Besides, I don't use G.C anymore since I once missed an event which I put a reminder through the G.C app because it never reminded me. I read one comment for this app that it never gave a reminder for a scheduled task and yes I have an idea why it happened.	-1

This planner has a beautiful UI but lacks the ability to sync tasks.... anywhere! Plus the tasks need to be able to mark as completed from the widget. IN any case, I use my planner to keep track of it all, I may lose my phone, then what? I won't know what to do out where to go. Tasks need to sync, and not with purple planner, with Google.	0

Been a paid member for years. They've been completely frozen in time, features people have begged for years have been ignored or if they do it takes them years to implement. Had to wait years just for dark mode. I saw a blog post on their site where the project manager boasts about travelling full time in his car with his family, explains a lot really. They've really let their (once) loyal users down. Hopefully another app comes along and eats their lunch because it's there for the taking.	0

I love the app EXCEPT that the widget does not remember customizations (such as default calendar, not using 24 hour time). If this could be more flexible and keep the settings of the apps I would definitely rate five stars. It's helped save time having multiple uses for one app but I need the widget compatibility	0
After searching through loads of Todo list apps finally found one that works for me, great interface, very customiseable, sad that some features are locked behind premium but works fine for free	1

It is an app with a good concept in mind. Only have to spend $1 to start putting your time to planting real trees. The downside is that you have a limit of planting only 5 trees. After I reached my limit, I started to lose motivation to use the app just to plant virtual trees.	1
Cool!!! No wonder you didn`t sleep much	1
its a good calendar! . Definitely bettwr then most and if they keep up Ill continue to use it. They also are constantly improving the app I'm having difficulties getting it to open on the correct day I'm sure it's just a setting I can't figure out the app keeps opening on a day for days from the current day	1

I agree with other reviewers here: the new notification redesign from v5.3.0 on Android 10 is a bad idea and results in a confusing and unhelpful user experience. The new notifications violate Google's Material Design standards, which Google have provided to app developers for a good reason: to provide a consistent user experience across all apps. The new notifications look strange and behave badly compared to standard Android notifications. Please kindly revert back to the official Android notification standards that you used prior to v5.3.0! I've also sent you an email providing more details about this.	-1

I paid for the pro version because the color coding in the free version didn't work properly. Come to find out that the pro version doesn't have daily tabs for tasks and notes as the free version does. But the paid version does color code. Gaining that feature isn't worth losing the other two. I feel robbed.	-1
Wonderful app and great customer service. This app has replaced 2 or 3 of my old apps. This is the most customizable list app I have found. Colors can change, tasks can be rearranged within a list, lists can be rearranged. Tasks don't need a due date or time, but can be assigned either, along with notifications or alarms if desired. I had a small issue with sound, emailed support, problem solved in just a few days. Excellent!	1
Disappointed, cant plan the same task over multiple days. Manually adding same task to repeat each day is a downside. Uninstalled.	-1
I only saw urs by chance. Who else would have that name! Think I`ll b missing 2nite too. Thank god for YouTube.	1
this app has really helped me work on some habits! I appreciate that it reminded me if I didn't enter information for a day. I would have liked features like setting a time for those messages, or cool sounds when I click that I've done something, but for a free app, this was good enough as it was!	1

This app and Todoist Web are nice products, but they do have their issues: 1. It's hard to know what to expect from Todoist in the future. Updates and fixes take a very long time, and there is no public roadmap or issue/request voting system. 2. Todoist promotes itself as great for the GTD method, but it lacks core concepts like Next Actions, Waiting For, and Reviews. 3. The app refuses to start if you don't like Google Services (GSF) on your phone.	0
Everything about this app is perfect! Except for the widget support. The widget doesn't update with the new tasks I make in the app. And I wish I could mark tasks as complete right from the widget. I would also like to be able to make multiple notifications for one task, or set one task to repeat multiple times a day. I also wish the notification for the mission would show up every time.

"Having migrated from Wunderlist (Thanks, MS) - really enjoying the similar experience I'm having with Todist. Definitely both worthy of the high praise it gets, and an alternative to Wunderlist for us migrating away. Pros: - The dark theme is really nice - ""Sections"" is a nice way to break up a list / project without having a sub list / project - Having colours assigned to different lists / projects, making it easier to categorise - Option to import from Wunderlist. Note I did not use this feature, but it's a pro because there's an option to i.e. I do not know how well it works or not Cons: - The resizing / reactiveness of the webapp isn't ideal ATM; on a 1920x1280 screen the web app occupies the middle third - Comments are a premium only feature, compared to being in the freebie section of Wunderlist - Ditto on labels being a premium only feature (hashtag support was available in Wunderlist) TL;DR: 4/5 Pretty awesome to-do app. I missing some of the features I had from a competitor but not deal-breakers"	1

Updates keep making the app worse for power users I can no longer type `3p` to make something due at 3pm when renaming a task.

Its a good app for everyday tasks. It takes time to customize it and its normal because its an RPG type. However I think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless. You can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want. This bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah..	1

I was really excited about the whole idea of this app, but theres this huge down side that I cant accept.

Seriously impressed with such a simple app. It's helped me go from writing list after lists in notebooks and losing them, to having it all on my phone whilst I'm out and about. Very convenient! I've already recommended to everyone I know who is like me with staying organized. Also being pregnant and having baby brain I find it hard to remember to take medication, so having a little reminder instead of an alarm is really handy. The snooze options are a wicked bonus. Thank you 🤩	1
Download it and then immediately uninstalled. Have to pay premium prices to get any features at all. Can't even set up reminders. Don't bother with this app.	-1

Hello Forest, i interest with this app to stay focus. It work when i press back button and app will warn, but there's some problems with other buttons: Forest don't detect when i press home button & task button, so i can open other app and my tree is still growing. Hope u can fix this or tell us why we still can press other buttons? Thanks	0

Superb app. My one piece of advice for others would be to set low, reasonable targets for yourself and slowly increase them over time. Much better to start going to the gym twice a week, succeed and increase from there than to set the goal of 7 days a week and fail and become disheartened when you dont hit it. App is superb though.	1

Haven't come across a better app if it's type. It's not a project management tool but you can have a list in your reminder! It's probably a big leap but if i could share the task list with somebody without exporting that would be cool. The notification, repeat, export control, is brilliant. Really helps me organise my home tasks without being frustratingly intrusive and distracting. I've tried a lot of applications, this is second to none!	1

It's easy enough to use as it is, but for a fully paid app, the graphs are incredibly lackluster and basically useless. All you get is some minuscule, measly bar graphs which are tiny...and get this, they don't even label the metric you're tracking as they are displayed in the order in which your goal list is. So unless you memorize that goal #7 is say exercise daily, you won't even know what you're looking at. Additionally, the streaks are glitchy as hell, and often times do not calculate correctly. Really wish they also had aggregate goals, for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate. Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs. And come on, add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month.	0

I paid for habitbull premium for the sync functionality, which fully does not work. I've tried reinstalling the app, reinstalling android, getting a new phone. No luck.

I downloaded and paid for this app several days ago. It has some good aspects. But now I literally HATE some other aspects of it! For example, if you set a specific time for a specific time (e.g. 1-3 pm), it DISAPEARS without giving you a chance to do anything with it. So, if you didn't finish that task, you are out of luck if you want to move it to somewhere else! How ridiculous it is! I'm really scared. I can't trust this tool. I have to switch to something else and cut my losses.	-1

I LOVED this app because it has a calendar and to-do list in one go. I can categorize my tasks and put subtasks below. But when I recently updated the app, no radio button to tick off for the subtasks. I handle a lot of tasks categorized. Plus the notes below the subtasks is not there anymore. You need to add more clicks. It was easy and organized. Now, in uninstalling. So sad, i thought I have found the app. Was about to go Premium to get the full benefits but uninstalling. 😢	1

Small but significant issue for me: I like to look ahead at the events and tasks or whatever I put into the calendar/widget in advance. BUT I wish there was a way to automatically go back (like a button) to today's date and events afterwards because I don't like having to manually click on the arrows to go back to today's date after I view my future months and events . Overall, awesome app! Hopefully something like this gets added , I really want to continue using this app. Thank you :) !	0

The app no longer works. I gave it 5 stars before and used it religiously every day, while supporting the devs as often as possible. Now when I try to start a new session nothing happens. There's a countdown in the notification bar but the app itself doesn't work. The big timer in the app is frozen and I'm able to use my phone freely. A week ago or so I couldn't complete any session since the timer and the session itself would just reset at some point, without me knowing. Highly disappointed	-1

Beautiful interface and design. Unfortunately most features are locked behind a subscription, including some important features such as viewing completed daily tasks. As is, other top rated To Do apps offer more features for absolutely no cost. Would consider paying a one time fee for it but the subscription is a deal breaker.	-1
It worked. Cool AND the gang!	1
It's an interesting idea, but this app missed some extremely important features, namely: a landscape mode, as well as a custom notification sound. Why? Those are extremely easy features to add! My use case is placing my phone on a stand in landscape mode so I can charge it while at work. I want a custom notification sound at work, and I want to be able to watch the timer go down without the screen stuck in portrait. Also, I keep the screen on, and the app disses me because I have the app open.	-1

This is a loser. Upgraded to premium without my permission for a free trial, no option in the app to return to free option. And I'm maxed out on tasks ON the premium.

The tracker has a clean interface and it's simple to set up habits. I've only experienced one glitch: sometimes when you're looking at the calendar view of a habit the heading won't show up. If I could improve the app I would make the habit description show up in the habit calendar page. Right now you have to click on the habit name to view the description. I would also make an option to include skip days so if you need to skip a habit it doesn't count against your streak progress.	1
Great App. Like the options of multiple routines, calender, and reminders. However I wish there was more control over the routines. I'd like to be able to pick the start of my day instead of it starting at 12am. I'd also like to be able to pick what week days for a routine to be active so I can have different routines each day. You can manually program it if you pay for pro version but it's a hassle to go day by day if the routine is going to be used for months.	1

This is exactly the app I was looking for to visual my day, as the clock face just makes sense. However, only being able to add to the schedule via external calendar apps makes this completely unusable. I tried to use it to better manage my routine, but my calendar app became so full of menial tasks that I was unable to see my upcoming appointments and events of most importance. It has amazing potential, but is currently only good for basic planning. Very disappointing.	-1

I uninstalled it within 20 minutes of paying for it. Its features don't work as hoped, especially font and color customization: the unpaid version advertised *presets*, aka themes. But they didn't exist in the Pro. This is on an Android 10, Oxygen 10.3.1 TMUS 1+6T. Developer, your 2020.3.3 reply makes no sense: it still doesn't take into account this *particular* phone or my specific terms. Here's to those themes in future releases, along with a dynamic icon, and the developer's professionalism.	-1

Great app so long as you only use the free version which only tracks 5 x habits. Used the free version for a couple of weeks then paid £9.49 for the platinum version so I could sync to other devices. Really disappointed that the sync option won't work, and software support is non existent. For an expensive app I would expect the developers to be as helpful as possible when a customer has an issue but they have completely ignored my request for help!	0

When Microsoft announced they were killing Wunderlist, my expectations for the New Thing were soooo low. I was spot on. Bloody hell its it's awful. Look how wunderlist works. 1. new items are added to the top 2. completed items are struck through _and_ moved to the bottom, and remain in completed order. 3. highlighted items are bounced to the top, which can then be un-highlighted. 4. items with low importance remain at the end. With _long_ lists old un-completed or permanent items migrate to the end of the list. Try a usability test with LONG lists.	-1

Even after several updates, the problem persists: Despite adding and sceduling tasks, the calender inside the app isnt showing any tasks at all. No tasks visible at all in the in-app calendar view.

It serves its purpose. I have not used too many others to compare. I wish I could set different reminder sounds. I HATE the ads after adding an appointment. Sometimes I have 2 things to add and have to wait, which is not ok when coordinating with a doctor's office.	0

I love that the app interface is so easy to use. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because you can't export notes. It would be ideal if that could be done.	1
There's some problem with the newest version. The app doesn't blacklist other apps anymore. Apart from that, this is a good app. Provides motivation to stay focussed. Edit on 2019/11/17 Please fix the new bugs. The app is crashing everytime I'm planting a tree after installing the new update.	0

Newest update nerfs the widget so you can't utilize as much functionality to it. The main app also features the annoying swipe to select feature now. The previous click to select was fine and this new change doesn't add anything, only creates a new barrier of frustration.	-1

Love it so far! I would like to be able to move appointments around on the same day. for example, they are listed in the order you enter them. But I want my am on the top of each page and my p.m. appointments in the afternoon on the month view. it would be great if you can just drag and drop. I also would like a printing feature for my lists so that I can actually print them out while packing.	1

Ruined a perfectly good app. Add task above/below features have been removed. When I create a new task it goes all the way to the bottom of the list. I have to then drag it all the way back up to the top of the list of 100+ tasks. App is now useless.	-1
Update: After getting a response from the developer I would change my rating to 0 stars if possible. These guys hide behind confusing and opaque terms and refuse to budge at all. I'm so annoyed that my money has been lost to them! Really terrible customer experience. Original: Be very careful when signing up for a free trial of this app. If you happen to go over they automatically charge you for a full years subscription and refuse to refund. Terrible customer experience and the app is just OK.	-1

For years we used Wunderlist, for work, including employees without corporate accounts, for family, outside organisation and across continents. ToDo failed from the get go, but to be fair, so do most other tasklist apps, we tried many. We finally moved to Trello - A bit different to Wunderlist and not quite as intuitive, but works across platforms, across organisations. It sadly seems MS loves to destroy good things. Wunderlist was such a good product, we were really sad to see it go.	-1

It's the best habit tracker out there but it's not the best it can possibly be. After a substantial amount of thought, I succumbed and shelled out the 10 euros for the premium version to be able to use the widget, which is essential to keep me on track. However, the widget doesn't respond unless the application is opened beforehand, so minus one star for that. Also, a true black widget or user-interface would be very nice for AMOLED screens, so fingers crossed for that too.	1

Now i have changed to oppo A9, the only issue i am facing, the reminders notifications which are not completed, disappear from my screen in the night same day. It's annoying for me because I have to find those incomplete reminders in the app one by one and set them again. It would be fine, if unfinished tasks should not disappear. Stars would be 5😊.

This app is very helpful! Total game changer for my ADHD. Unfortunately, after level 25 the app becomes a money grab and the items you find and the equipment you can buy with coins get severely capped. But overall I'm happy this app exists, it really helps me stay on track :) Perhaps if the game cost a few dollars to purchase the developers wouldn't need to resort to capping in order to create revenue from the app. I feel as though many people will quit once the RPG element is restricted.	0

The ideal task mamager for me! Perfect combination of ability to customize tasks, design and great for team work. Still would be better if tasks added to My lists wouldn't automatically add to all tasks where Today, Tomorrow etc sections are. Sometimes I need them to keep in my lists and not be added to lists with some time attachment:) If possible, I am your fan forever !	1
Works great on the phone but had trouble multi-tasking on my tablet. The tablet version doesn't let me open a language learning app (or similar apps for that matter) without sending a warning message and killing my tree, not fun to use when you can't do what you set out to do. Such a shame. EDIT: Thanks for the response, I reinstalled it and tried again but the app whitelist is now only with premium in the current version. :(	0

Used to work ok, now, something is skrewy. Now, if I restart my phone, EVERY SINGLE task comes up as a notification, never mind of when the tasks were/are due, and the schedule I set. Now, after I dismiss tasks, they pop up again, ignoring its schedule. Also, wish app could remember which day the task is for. If you have a daily task that you complete after midnight, it thinks you completed it early and won't remind you later that day. Finally, wish app opened to an overview of all lists.	-1

"I used to like this app. Been using it for a few years with tolerably okay results. But it's been having too many problems with sync, and with failing to load ""Karma"" data. Not only that, but if you miss checking a box but don't see that omission until the next day, there's nothing you can do about it. Maybe the fatal flaw of this app is that it has too many features for its own good. I'd like to get rid of sync entirely and just use the app on my Android, but apparently that can't be done, and if I delete my online account I delete everything. I think I just want to dump this flawed app and see if I can find a good app that does everything offline in one device with no registration required."	-1

Would give 5 stars if it wasn't buggy and didn't cause me to miss a task. The calendar widget is a complete failure. It randomly removes some of the calendars that are synced and creates a duplicate of repeated tasks when they are marked as complete. The whole reason I subscribed to this app was because I needed to sync all my calendars and make my life easier by maintaining them all in one place and not miss any appointments or tasks. The app is useless if I can't rely on it to display and sync correctly. Fix the bugs and I'll reinstall and change to 5 stars.	1

Great motivator to keep a habit going. Also good for keeping track of habits you already have. They have great, insightful options that help you set your goal.

In my opinion, it is the best app for reminders and to do. I use it every day to plan and organize my day. Some features I constantly use are Google calendar integration, focus mode and priority tags. The interface is also very clean. Great work, Any.do team	1
Good app does what you need it to do, a little light on instruction or where to find them as i know the app has more functionality, but don't know without some digging where to find it, also wouldn't mind if the Pro version had more features to entice people to buy it or if the free version had a few adds per day for the dev. 😊	1

This is update on 22 Feb 2020 I don't know what happened to the app, but it now annoys me every second time i open it, with some ridiculous animated games, which hijack the whole phone for about 30 seconds, and then goes to Google Play, asking to download the idiotic game. Not sure if it's the app itself, or if it's been hacked. In either case I AM UNINSTALLING THIS! ========= Excellent app, I've been using it for many years now, since its predecessor..... all good with app :-)	-1

Wow, this is so slick. Has to be the most polished app I have ever used. Not really surprised as the web, Windows and iOS are all superb as well. This is so worth the $4 a month.	1
You win, take my money. I have been using this app for many years and never bought the upgrade. I recently upgraded to the S10, and between Bixby, Google, and many planning apps, I just couldn't separate myself from this one. I simply have not found an app that's easier to add and complete tasks. Also the task widget is just hands down better than every other one out there. So fine, if you want to add fullscreen ads (and have the audacity to include sound) then take my money you can have it.	1

Got this when I realized I got most distracted from my work by looking at my phone. Really helps me focus when I need to. I didn't want one of those apps that completely locks down your phone in case I actually needed to use it for something important, but I don't want to kill my trees for unimportant stuff. Also I like that they have a variety of trees that you have to work to get. It makes me more motivated to use the app. I hope they add more season-themed trees (snow covered would be cool!)	1

"Updating my previous review. I recently hit the two year mark on one of my habits, yet the app only shows me of having 30 days. This is the same bug I reported last year. It appears that it does not recognize some of my habits over the New Year. I've reported this problem four times now and have never heard back from anyone. I'm giving up on this app, and suggest you do too. ""I've used this for a couple of years. There was a bug where one week of my tracking wasn't recognized by the app. This happened the week of New Years. I reached out to the developer five times about it and never heard back. Unfortunately, this has become an unreliable app for tracking."""	-1

Even if I click the other one to make it even, it just registers it as a separate log.	0

When this happens I may consider doing the premium. Until then the 7 day trial is pointless to see how the service completely works. Maybe one day...😥"	-1

Enough with the pop-up ads! I don't mind if an app has ads, but if I'm going to be interrupted by a 15 second video every 5 seconds while I'm checking off my list I'm deleting your app. And no, I'm not going to subscribe just because you keep popping up the subscription page. If I have to pay to make the app decently usable, you may as well require I pay for it to begin with.	-1

I love the concept of the app I'm just not digging the functionality. Trying to set a custom date and time is a complete pain in the you know what. Every time I select pm it's stays at am. I have to do it multiple times before it catches. Same issue with the clock. I try to rotate the dial to select an hour and it hangs and throws me over to minutes. I go back to hours and it does the same thing. I finally just gave up. Back to the old string around the finger. ☹️	0

felï¿½z dia de madres | happy mothers day	1
This app works really well. It let's me organize my tasks & reminds me when they're due, with the ability to give me the option of reminding me early, much like the calendar on my phone. I just like having this app as a backup reminder so I don't screw up & forget them (which I seem to be able to do occasionally anyway). Since I've yet to find any bugs, I highly recommend this app.	1

I love this game. It has helped me do much It's a bit of a learning curve. It would be nice if challenges were visible from the app in all of the guilds, and I would also like to see the last day and time that a habit was marked, because the colors don't always change and if you have a lot of habits it gets confusing. Otherwise, this app is brilliantly done and will be getting my monetary support in whatever way I can afford.	1

App idea and design is great, but it is not possible to add calendar from Work Profile account anyhow - it is just invisible. Android 7.1.1. Promise rating 5, if fixed.

I used to really love this app and I still do for its flexibility and functionality. I was considering getting the pro version but because I am a small business owner, it was not yet necessary. Since the recent change to the new add format, I am watching full screen adds and waiting for them to finish (oftentimes no skip option). The adds are so obnoxious that the first time it appeared I tought I was hacked. It's hampering my productivity and now it has also put me off getting the pro version..	0

Don't bother installing this app. The free version is garbage. Recently the developer made the decision for inclusion of ads. The ads pop up every time you add an event to the Calendar. The developer has chosen to sacrifice usability of the app and consumer comfort in the rush to monetise the app. I have uninstalled it and will not be returning to the app again.	-1

I took my review down to 3 stars because the plants are more expensive now which means there is less incentive to grow trees and save money because the goal of buying a new plant seems out of reach	0

This application is good in a way that you can prioritize and organize your tasks. The thing is that, the important features such as the 'alarm' for notification of reminders and sharing of documents are only allowed in premium package and as a student I would not be able to avail these features monthly. I wish that you can add a feature wherein you can personalize your notes so it will be more fun and exciting to use.	0

I miss Wunderlist. Don't like this app because I can't copy a tasks or project by copying to another section.

Hope the icons can be more rich and appealing.	1

Recently replaced Wunderlist with this app, after getting used to it I have to say I prefer this app. I like that once you pick a sorting sequence for each category it automatically carries out this function when you add a further entry ie due date. I would have preferred that a folder for completed tasks etc was retained but other than that I'm happy with this app.	1
Great app if you want to get rid of bad habits, or reinforce good ones. The free version of it is not as restrictive as most free versions of apps, so that is a big plus . I honestly never really wrote a review on playstore before, but this app legitimately helped me overcome a few of my most detrimental bad habits. To the people that made the app, thank you for taking the time to make an amazing app! I hope that everyone has a wonderful day!	1

I`ll most definitely write about it! I look forward to your article on RE5 (if you do write about it) It should be fun.	1
This is a nicely made app and premium is cheap, but one critical flaw is the reminder sound runs through the ringtone channel instead of the alarm channel, or even the media channel. So unless you enjoy hearing every single notification go off on your phone or your ears are super sensitive to vibrations from across the room this app is not fit for purpose.

The best app of its kind, hands down. The only thing I would improve is the reminder system: right now the app would send you a notification to complete a habit/task even after you've already done it, when in my opinion it should automatically turn off. It's a minor thing, but it tends to get a bit silly when you've completed a lot of tasks ahead of schedule. Other than that, it's perfect.	1

I absolutely LOVE this app! I am a very OCD person when it comes to being organized and love my planner but really wanted something digital...very portable and environmentally friendly... I found it here! I love the way it syncs in seconds across my devices, phone, iPad, Google home device, and laptop. It’s super user friendly and very customizable! I tried several other digital planners and this one beats them hands down!	1
not quite as good as Wunderlist for me... but overall decent and as I need to use this for work now (as wunderlist blocked!) I am trying to get into it broadly. premium features seem quite pricey.	0

Moved from wunderlist and am disappointed by the lack of functionally. For example, there is no option to show weekly tasks and to display tasks in the widget they need to be moved manually!	-1
i have twitter, sooo i`m pretty **** cool now	1
I don't get a notification or any alarm after i set the due date reminder at all. I've already tried a couple of times how do i fix this. My settings also allow notifications for the app. Also how do i set widget on home screen thanks.	-1

sorry I missed you at the farm today, but DM me if you would like some photos from today	-1
Great app. Love everything about it, especially the multi select option. Would love to see the task/tool bar at the bottom rather than the top, it would make one hand operation a lot easier.	1

Awesome app, the only missing thing is that you can only set a date, I would like to have buttons to remind me later on the day. Or on the next day, or next week. UPDATE: No what I meant, is that I want to say remind me today and not remind me at date today at specific time. UPDATE: I would then receive the notification, at a specific time 5 hours later or something that can be altered in the settings. And also I don't want to put in a date! Look at the app TickTick has exactly what I want. :)	-1

Horrible experince. Glitchy and slow with no user friendly interface. Waste of time to download check it out and uninstall after 10 minutes. On top of that the most important features are paid. But wait... its a subscription to pay £4 monthly!! For a todo app which can't do something better than the hundreds free or those with one time payments. Cannot recommend to anyone.	-1

This app is too good it is helping me and futher it will to be staying focused at a particular thing for a particular period of time	1
A great app for setting routines, simple to use and very customizable. A slight learning curve for the routine setting, eg. The +/- symbols. A few things that could be improved: easily assigning routine for each day rather than programming a period of time (from the pro version) or the same routine (from the free version). Also the widget could be more useful if it indicated the ending time as well. The comment text style could also be better differentiated title/tag of the event.	1

so far so good! relatively easy to use. I was really hoping to be able to check off routine items when completed. trying to build up on habits. so it would be great to be able to track completed progress. calendar sync in pro verson went seamless! however when i go to change a routine item because it conflicts with a calendar appointment,there is not option to just edit that one Tuesday. its either all Tuesdays or no Tuesdays. It would be great to see date options & completed progress tracking	1
could you make an option to not stop the trial because i dont think some people want to do the trial and it doesn't mention that before you download the app and when you do you guys get paid.	-1

The best widget! You can swap lists without ever leaving your home screen. And they're all color coded, yay! I like that you can use it simple way or a complicated way, depending on what you need, but the complexity never gets in the way of the simple use. Thank you for this app.	1

Highly recommend using it as a shared task list with your spouse!!	1

Great app! Like that you can get a reminder for your task, either as a notification or alarm. One can also choose to write a task that doesn't have a reminder. Therefore you can also easily create lists, like a shopping list. It has the feature for quick add for that purpose.	1
Great app for staying focused, good way to track your time spent working in a more fun and engaging way	1

I really like this app. Even when you are retired one needs some order to keep balance in one life. I have learned to appreciate its benefits: tasks (the little things we seem to forget every day), shopping lists, reminders and the themes that makes it fun. 👍👍	1

Really disappointed to find recurring tasks functionality is only available with the paid version. Would not recommend. Also it doesn't sort tasks by date and time properly.	-1
BULL: I've been using it for 2 weeks and it's okay, except for the fact that the widget doesn't work most of the time. I have to open the app directly to be able to list activities, which renders the widget useless. I paid for the upgrade which makes this issue all the more frustrating!	0

failed inspection. Did you know you can pass wo/oven, but not wo/anti-tip bracket, which is only sold w/oven? This is worse than taxes.	-1
Uninstalled...Not at all what I thought it was. This entire app is basically just a fancy way to look at the calendars you already have. Everything syncs both ways, so if you add your actually daily schedule minute by minute to this app you are also cluttering up your calendar(s) with the same things. Would've been neat if it actually had some kind of function, but I don't need to waste sd card space on a calendar viewing app.	-1

Fun for university students The only problem is they don't order the tasks by date, do you have to be careful not to miss homework. Now that i think about it, it's actually a big problem for students using the app. It is fun, overall, and I do homework to keep my avatars alive. Think Tamagotchi	1

"No experience with it. install / ""Open"" goes to a login screen. No thanks. I do not want to login to use this. I'd appreciate it if developers would say upfront that their app is not a standalone, local, private version. Too bad, could have been just what I need, otherwise. Sure looks good. To dev: thanks for the response. I rechecked. Neither the images nor writeup specifies an account is MANDATORY. ""can"" is different than ""must"". Updated with Extra star for prompt service. Thx."	0

Dissapointing. In some few days, it can' t be open. I already download it for two tines and nothing change. Please fix this one!😓	-1
Disappointing and unreliable. It's sad to see this app struggles to be as great as its predecessor: Wunderlist. If you set a daily reminder and one day forget to mark it as complete, the app will not remind you again about it. If the due date and reminder date are different you will not be reminded about the task. I don't care if I'm receiving a notification about a thing I had to do 3 weeks ago I just wanna be reminded. No one is this strict with dates. I hope this helps improve the app.	0

this is the best app I have ever used to keep track of my activities.The greatest part is that each time you feel like giving up to achieving your objectives, it will always remind you, which is very motivating. I only have one problem though,having trouble with syncronising my progress, which means if the app was to be accidentally uninstalled and then reinstalled again, then all the progress I had saved would be lost, so this one reason I give you a 4 star rating instead of a 5.Good app though	1

Why this app requires so much of settings in one time.. 1)Like it should be in recent apps..2) If internet is off it doesn't works..3) Even though all the permissions to app is allowed in phone settings..

Very useful app if you are in the habit of forgetting things. But it has one major defect.

Love this simple app. It works well..apart from the odd inconsequential blip. It has helped me to organise my day, list all my to-dos so they're not in my head. It's simple enough to learn how to use quickly and I've got my daily schedule on repeat so regular events pop up daily, weekly, monthly or as one off dates.	1

This app is literally the only thing that reminds me to take my meds. I love getting the notifications and tracking my progress so easily.

For $10, I would hope that the one feature I wanted would function like it's supposed to. I'm not happy about that at all. The home screen widget comes in handy so it's not a total loss but that alone is not worth the price. Please fix syncing!	1

I find the app inflexible and buggy, with a counter intuitive UI. How to delete or rename tags was not obvious. Using the back button would often exit the app at unusual times. After adding a new tag the app wouldn't allow me to do anything until I exited and restarted. Plus, the premium features seem more like essential features, to me. Looking for an alternative app as we speak.	-1

Kept crashing, rss feed if my calendar duplication of entries was HUGE and overall it just added to the noise rather than helping.. I'm out..

I LOVE this app. I've always had a hard time with planners because I just couldn't see the point, but that allows me to plan and have fun. I feel like I'm constantly playing a video game, but the main character is me! It has definitely improved my life! Thanks a ton, developers!	1

App is great, it's simple enough to use. What would be great is the ability to add in a password protect function for any notes you enter in. Also 1 thing that annoys me (hence the 3stars) is that I find more often than not that when I type words, the preview screen truncates the first 2-3 letters and replaces them with dots. ** Developer very quick responding to feedback =)	1

I was looking for exact same app for a long time. And this is the app. After using this app for about a week, I understood my time and routine better than ever! I was amazed to see that I had more than 40 hours available a week whereas I thought I didn’t have enough time in my life. I strongly recommend to those who wants to get the blessings of a routine. And I suggest the developers that if you can bring a option to view the routine in a printable weekly calendar that would be better. Thanks	1

I have been using this app for years, but I am thinking of trying a different app. The issue that I have, is that doing seemingly simple tasks is overly complicated. For example I just want to make a personal and a work task list that is local to my phone. Doing so has proven very complex and often I will create a task only to realize it has defaulted to my gmail account rather than the local list I intended. As a user it's frustrating, the reason I use this app is to streamline organization.	0

App is good but the programmer feature is bad. I have created multiple small routines which i want to enable from programmer based on my work meetings for different days. So if I have late meetings on Wed and Fri, I want to enable a separate set of routines for these days. Similarly for weekends. The programmer is allowing for just dates which is not the feature that I bought the pro version for. I want small, reusable routines that I can configure from programmer for days not periods of dates.	-1

I did like the app..after I'm reinstalling the app..what happens to my In app purchase..I had purchased the app..Rt now which I'm using is it the paid one or free one. Do I need to pay for premium again??	0
have to put my dog down tomorrow.	0
Bought premium. Exactly what I was looking for. Amazing job and what I need to help me in life. Giving it 5 stars even though I have one suggestion. Possibly have it where you can have a single habit occur twice. Like say example I want work out but I want to work out at 3pm and 7pm. I saw another app have it but still this one is best hands down.	1

Having to find players to be able to do anything is a bit annoying, it's really boring otherwise. Reminders don't work properly - I set a bunch for last night that never happened, and a bunch this morning that never happened.

This is the only app that does what it does and I love the functionality. The only problem is the app is quite buggy and I haven't seen or noticed any updates in years. Would also be nice if there was a website to go with it. I am finally giving up and moving to day by day which leverages google calendar and google tasks. If google would just incorporate tasks into its calendar better, that would do it all.	1

I like the app. It works, it's functional, and it's great. However, one thing still strikes me down. Why the hell are reminders a paid feature? Seriously, what's a To-Do app without reminders? I could use even my calendar, or almost any other app, and that would too have reminders, for free. So why should I pay for such a basic feature on a fully fledged app?	-1

The app itself is really great. However, if you are going to buy premium, please make an account first, then buy premium. I bought premium without an account and was fine until I switched phones. I couldn't buy premium again because the option had disappeared but I didn't have access to premium features. I had even emailed support about the issue and gave the invoice number from Google play store. No response. This is enough to make me not use the app again.	0

Great until last update. Love the app, its a great tool, but since the last update, I frequently get server error notifications, and the app doesn't function in any capacity (can't chat in party, dailies and habits don't refresh, etc.). rebooting my phone and reinstalling the app did not solve the issue. I'd happily give this a 5-star if this could be fixed and I could get back to my daily log-ins and updates.	0

Very nice looking, the pricing is just right, and I love that you can have subtasks upon subtasks. But... almost nothing about it is intuitive. For an app that is all about helping the user be more productive, to have a new or occasional user blundering around poking and prodding until the app lets them accomplish basic tasks... well that is obviously detrimental to productivity and a surefire way to accidentally encourage customer churn. UX test your app please.	0

One of the main sticking points for me is how well an app does recurring tasks. In particular, not just fixed date recurrences, but the ability to set the next date off the last completion date. So many apps fail to offer this. Alas, I could find NO way to do a recurring task at all, in spite of them saying it can be done. So, much less checking on this nuance, I see no way of doing them at all. Fail. Moving on.	-1

I have been using the PRO version for several years now. It has many nice features and sophisticated calendar widget with many customization options. Sadly, lately there have been problems with task synchronization. As I mostly use tasks/todos for organizing and use multiple devices, this is a big issue for me. While developers are responsive and say it have fixed the problem it still persists at least for me.	1

Whenever creating a new event, it doesn't use the calendar's default reminders, which Google Calendar does, so I have to use Google Calendar to add new events. This kind of defeats the purpose of having this app installed. Also, constant popups nagging to buy premium. I'd buy premium to improve my experience, not to make it more bearable.	-1

Do you wish to NOT be a retard? Well... too bad. Simply owning this app means you acknowledge how useless you are to life and should, instead of uninstalling the app, uninstall yourself irl. 2 stars because the app is not entirely useless.

I am heavy calendar user I use it to schedule every hour of my day but I can't do anything similar with this app except to remind me at certsin time.

Dead stopped in the express lane. This would happen when I choose to take it. No way out now. Ugh. Hopefully this gets moving	0
It would be good if it had alot of tasks that are given by the app accordingly to your interest, and even recommend books, etc. Also if there was a competitive mode where you can see what level other players are, and that to level up you have to do certain things that can be verified somehow (for example, read book requires a picture of a book with your face, or run requires a tracking through the GPS to actually verify yoy ran) in this way it can even be competitive	0
I am facing sync issues. Yesterday I added a todo from my laptop chrome website. Today I didn't get it's notification on my phone. It's when I opened the app when I see that it's being added. This should have been done in the background.	0

It is a great app. But still there is space for some improvement. The calendar for example: you have one to add more tasks, other to see each specific task and the days that you did the job, but note one to see the sum of all tasks. You should create a resume calendar, where I can see the percentage of jobs that I accomplished in each day.	1

For some reason I can't edit my other review on the phone, or if I can it's not clear how. Lists are not in an intuitive place imo, so I missed them entirely, resulting in that erroneous post. If this supported arbitrarily nested task levels I'd give it five stars, but I'm definitely going to use this. R.I.P. Wunderlist	1
Just what i needed. I especially love the subtasks function. The only suggestion is to make the layout more compact. I set up tasks on a calender using another app and they use similar fields but have a smaller popup window for setup. I love your color design much better and it makes me want to open the app and update regularly	1
This is so complicated it took me awhile to to figure all the stuff. I would suggest add some tutorial on YouTube so anyone can get used to it. and the app is solid and will think about purchasing the pro version.	0
Finally a chance to show genuine love, not dependent selfish love, I hope I can do it. My heart goes out to you and I`m sorry 4 ur pain.	1

So far so good. I love creating my own adventure. Still learning some of the functions. Maybe a tips video could help. I can't wait to see what other fun things can be added. More community or friends list. Or leader board. Then get us to do in app purchases for new items or level streaks. I just like this a bunch. So thank you!	1

This app is useful. BUT. It would be so much more useful if you could set a routine to be repeated every weekday/ weekend day/ week/2week/4week/month/etc. It is badly in need of this feature. I thought buying pro would allow me to do this and it hasn't helped at all and I'm disappointed I spent the money. Please say that it is an upcoming feature. Resetting routines for every day is really inconvenient!	0
Another water leak in my appartement. The good side is that I get to meet the girls previous & next floors	1
Hi, I previously posted a review to this app and I was furious. I gave it a single star because many choices are premium. But when I started to use the app, I learnt that this is app is really good for productivity. And I am glad that I am using it. I can't say it's perfect without you paying for the premium version but it's pretty good app.!	1
"This is pretty great but has what I think is a major bug. In the settings you can choose a default for reminders. So, I choose ""an hour before"". That means, to me, that if I say something is at 2pm, it will remind me at 1pm. However, instead, TickTick sets the task for 3pm and the reminder for 2pm. This is, obviously, wrong. Fix that and its 5 stars but as it stands, I now have to set each reminder individually, which is a pain."	0

New lay out is awful and takes extra steps to do everything that was once easy. App no longer syncs to my computer app, which has syncing problems of own. Since the last update it's slow on either set up and honestly no longer as good which is upsetting as I paid for the full year right before the update that screwed it all up. I really hope you guys are working to fix the lag, the lay out and the syncing problem. This last update was a terrible idea	-1

Love it and it's good start to build on! But there appears to be syncing issues between calendars no matter how many times I refresh. I'm going to give it time before I give up on it. I'm big on my Happy Planner and would totally ditch it for this if it had similar features, such as a budget planner one could add. I wouldn't use most of the stickers, which is unfortunate because I love my stickers in my planners. Overall....good start?	-1

The features and functionality are pretty good, with support for Google Tasks. BUT the homescreen widget doesn't load at all on Android 9 after restarting the device. One has to remove it and reinstall it, which is a pain. AND the support team was not helpful at all. They went from suggesting a solution which suggested they didn't understand their own app to being completely unresponsive.	-1

Very sad story of being Wunderlist ancestor. Missing Drag and Drop Missing UX at all Missing ease of using Creating of new task requires your full attention for several painful seconds.

I have been using this app for years. I get really hooked on committing to longer focus times just to unlock the full potential of the trees offered (there are different aspects to the tree with different amounts of study time, ie less than 60mins, greater than 60mins, and a special one for 2 hours of focus, plus bushes). As someone with ADHD (and OCD, which may explain my obsession with this app), studying wouldn't be the same without Forest! 🌲	1
I tried to explore it a little after downloading, I want something that will show me everything planned on the day I have notes on rather than me having to search if I do, i tend to forget due to busy schedules. I want automatic pop up, I'll keep playing with it, but so far dislike	-1
off to work! missing out on all the sunshine!	-1
I love this app. I really struggle to concentrate when I have a pile of papers to mark or some other boring stack of work and Forest helps me to stay off my phone for reasonable stretches of time. Like I really care about my virtual forest and don't want to kill any trees so scrolling insta is just not worth it.	1

If you're a procrastinator this app will change your life! I have a tendency to avoid the things I need to do by snacking or playing video games so this app has been perfect for me. I'm great at making to-do lists but suck at execution. This app has helped me with so many areas of my life, chores around the house, my quality of work at my job, I've even been using it to develop safer driving habits. The community is also very supportive, it's really fun to play with a friend and party up.	1

Would like to be able to change the default reminder time without having to amend every one, and would like to see support for tasks from non exchange accounts (e.g hotmail etc.) but even with these unavailable to me the app is still amazing. I thoroughly recommend this.	1

Finally an excellent personal workflow tool from Microsoft! To Do is a great tool for smartphones, syncing with Outlook tasks and flagged email to deliver a dedicated task management dashboard. The My Day feature promotes a GTD approach, but might be improved by sorting on a numbered list rather than simply on high or normal priority. Each task can have subtasks, but subtasks lack due dates, notifications, etc. Projects are not explicitly addressed but can be managed by adding task lists.	1

Really beautiful and great idea. It is unfortunate for anyone who doesn't buy into all things Google and don't use Google Callander. In this day, building your app to only one service is not a good idea unless it's for the iPhone. Now if I could get my work calendar on this app, wow, what a great way to visualize your day.

I like this app, but it really annoys me that it defaults to playing a chime when you first pick up your phone in the morning. When just checking the time, I don't want to be woken up even more.

I liked it when I first got it several years ago. But after installing it on several devices, I found it does not sync with the other instances of it. After getting no response from their support desk, I uninstalled the three apps from the three devices and reinstalled them using my google account in case I had not logged in with the same account on all. The three new instantiations do not sync. The help desk is non-existent. The idea is good but the app is defective.	-1

The main purpose of this app is to not allow us to open other apps like social media. However when I accessed other apps after pressing the home button I could use them(note:my wifi was off)The app was running in the background while i could use my phone completely.Please fix it. And a suggestion would be to put a feature to select some apps we want to access while doing our work(other than calls) like 'notes'. I need some apps while I study(like I keep important notes I need while I study)	-1
Useful app In my opinion what can make your app a 5 star is add parsonalized image to tasks and possebility to make predefined tasks that you can add them to any list and global research you can find any task in all lists. Thank you for replying to my comment	1

Really good and super helpful.

This app is great! I love the idea of turning my daily life like an RPG game. But I have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing. So can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed? Been trying my hardest to do this on your app, even finished reading the user guide, but it still wouldn't work.	1
mom said no.	0
There are a lot of really cool feature with this app, but I stopped using it almost as soon as I started because of one key missing feature - the calendar view. It's weird to me that a planner app doesn't have a calendar view. It has a calendar sync option if you pay for it, but I'm not going to buy it only to find out that is not what I want. Could also be greatly improved if it included tasks and projects. Really awesome functionality, but missing some core essentials for me	0

I really like this app - its a lovely interface, simple to use and very useful to have both tasks and notes with the calendar. Is there any possibility of adding a folder/tag/category function to the notes? It would be so helpful - I make notes on a varietu of things as I go along, and its really useful to be able to store them by day, but it would also be great to be able to sort them by tags or folders. Anyway - just a suggestion. Otherwise a lovely app. Thanks :-)	1

Thanks once again for the great app!!!	1
Its good. The only thing that is missing is the time inclusion. Like at what time a particular task is planned. If that can be added, it would be perfect. It would be like a personal calendar and activity planner together. I hope that can be added.	0

Horrible! So many steps!...Set a due date, set a reminder, set it to display in My Day. The reminder set screen is 2 different screens for date/time. The My Day section is the only way you can organize by reminder time for scheduling purposes. Once it's in My Day you must manually move the items in time sequence. Takes up way too much time to organize your day! Importing did not work after several attempts. The setting reset themselves to default after I set them.	-1

I can`t wait to see UP! How dare have a 'real' job. Probably going to have to wait until tomorrow.	0
Tried this app for a bit. The logic is very different from what I need, so the experience wasn't good. This app focuses on routines and is built around this concept. It was very confusing at first (because it started with abstract ideas, not what average joe is already familiar with; e.g. calendar/timeline) and the entire experience just felt awkward. For me, all I want is, see the day/week/month, add to-do items one by one, and be able to turn any of these items into routines when I want to.	0

"Busted from the start. On the first open of the app I got a 3 pane swipe intro and the first 2 were blank purple screens. Then, on the Avatar creation screen the Avatar wasn't visible. When finally getting in to the app the ""help text"" bubble didn't point at anything, just the bottom of the screen for the whole dialogue. This app sounded interesting but it seems there's a complete lack of interest in quality."	-1

I very much enjoy this app. it has helped me greatly and its easy and fun to use. There is one issue though. I do not enjoy having an app call me affectionate names such as darling and sunshine. Quite frankly it makes my stomach turn everytime this happens. I like this app so much I bought the premium version but the fact that the app was calling me pet names made me almost delete it. I plan on continuing to use habitbull but I sincerely hope this weird occurrence is changed.	1

Great task and project management app. User friendly and versatile. Lists and sub lists work well for most to do list requirements. Would just recommend to developers to introduce a couple of improvements... 1) there should be a difference between the date you plan to do a task and its deadline/due date. 2) would be great to be able to add a description and deadline to a sub list thereby creating little projects.	1

At first I thought 'wow this can do everything! It's exactly what I need.' When I downloaded it and got to test it out, I noticed the features I needed the most were on premium. I'm fine with that, but only if premium was a one time payment. Not monthly payments for a membership. Monthly payments are for bills, taxes, video subscriptions, vpns, maybe even online storage subscriptions, but most definitely not calendars or to do lists. Those should stay as free or a small one time payment.	-1
gimme some ! i wanna try it (Soulja Boy Tell `Em LIVE live > http://ustre.am/2UhS)	0
Used to be a great app though the most recent update has made the widget unusable. Too small to see and there is no way to change the size, you also can no longer select multiple tasks, or pop out the widget to see multiple days. I requested to go back to the previous version, but didn't get much response so now I'm looking for a replacement.	-1

"I use this app to track various symptoms of my IBS. I also tried HabitHub and Loop, but only this app allowed me to track on a daily basis how many times a certain symptom occurred, and also set ""goals"" based on either ""no more than"" and ""no fewer than"" a given number of occurrences. I preferred the interface and graphs (I'd like to see a chart of raw numbers instead of just pass/fail) in some of the other apps, but from a purely functional standpoint this is the one to beat."	1

Thanks for the quick work! Everything works now. I really do like this app and use it on the daily, so I'm glad it's working again	1
Just moved from Wunderlist. Transition was easy. To Do is different in layout, but also intuitive & works fine on many platforms. I wish they have 2 things fixed/updated to meet Wunderlist feel: 1) Importance mark (the renown star) should be entered while typing a task. Importance mark should also put automatically the task on top of the list. 2) 'Show completed tasks' must be more 'handy', with a button, symbol or shortcut. Not as part of the menu (top right). 5 stars. Hope above of a help.	1

Nice design but...have been a happy wunderlist customer for a long time and the feature very important to me...being able to sort my list with a long press and slide up or down ...made it fast and easy to prioritize my day and make quick changes. The inbox was also a feature which was very important to me and gave me the confidence of not losing important info while on the fly. I realize that MiCrosoft To Do is NOT Wunderlist but hoping for these features to be restored	1

Excellent app and honestly my life would be so disorganised without it. Really helps me to stay on track. My only request would be to give me greater control over when events repeat than the current setup of every day, week, 2 weeks, etc. (E.g. Allow me to repeat events on weekdays or even better specific days. Like Mondays and Wednesdays for instance.) Otherwise the app is sublime. If this small detail is added then I see no reason to withhold my 5 start reading from you. Great app.	1

This app has great potential but is not there yet. Example, if a task repeats but without notification, then you manually mark it completed. The task is shown as completed & should advance to the next scheduled date. Instead it is showing up the next day as past due. But, if the task repeats with notification, then on the due date/time the system instantly advances the due date but does not show the task as completed so you have no record of the task due today & I have overlooked many. Not good!	0

A to do list is a really clever way to look into progress you have made in a day so, it is not just about completing the task it is about looking into the progress you have made by glancing at completed tasks. You don't get default features to see the competed tasks to enable that you have to go into settings and enable that and if you are not interested in compiled tasks anymore you can't just delete those tasks for that you have to select each task individually and then delete it.	0

I LOVE this app! It is flexible, intuitive, attractive, and has features I have been looking for and have been unable to find in the other task list apps i have tried.	1
While i can understand limiting somethings for premium only, i've never seen an app block widgets behind a pay wall and quite frankly this is only useful to me if I can keep track of things on the homescreen. Maybe I would have liked it but so far i havent used it because i keep forgetting its there.	-1

I really liked this app, however I have downloaded it yesterday and created tasks which repeats daily but it always shows tasks date 30 March. It was just the date I created it, it repeats daily so the dates should change too. It feels as if I am checking undone tasks from the past. Even in the calander view these tasks are not added to 31 March. It's annoying me. Please do something about it.	1

It's effective. Yes it's better than a lot of other options out there. It's just dated, the interface is weak and difficult to navigate. They could really make some strong improvements by streamlining it. I bet most users, pro or not, aren't aware of all the settings. Response 8/8/19: Thanks for the offer but I think you're missing point. If I had time to help I would have long ago though. Response: I wouldn't have paid for an app that required me that much submit feedback in a forum.	0

Awesome 😊 since we have online school I can use this for a schedule!	1
if you can't add subtasks? everything else in the app is quite impressive except this, i added a project and it disappeared from my projects tab, and i couldn't add any subtasks to it.. so it is indistinguishable from a regular task.	0

The widgets look great, and i like the idea behind this app, but it feels like im fighting it to create goals where i would have to start over completely to make it a single task vs a quantity. also my biggest issue is that you cant set a quantity per week, only per day. i want to be able to set x number of hours per week doing a task without any daily requirements	1

Would have given more stars if the add folder option was not removed from the original Wunderlist To Do List. I also used to be able to take photos offline and they will be automatically uploaded when I'm online. Now I must be online to even use my camera. I also do not like the idea that when you add a new note or something it stays at the bottom. These notes should automatically move to the top like how it did in Wunderlist. Otherwise the App is helpful for most of what I do.	0

In timeline section, I cannot see the upcominh events (I can only see the events for today and next day), and that kills the purpose of the time table apps. People need to see the upcoming event, in order to schedule nrw events, so they wont overlap with each other. Keep up the good work, and this will be a good app😎	-1
Great app if you keep it to a short list of achievable habits, fun to use, good statistics for tracking progress, you can input things retroactively if you forget at the time, has dark theme, customization options when it comes to tasks, skills, and characteristics. Lightweight, easy to use. Overall I don't think I have any complaints, it delivers what if says it does well, no more, no less. Tldr: love it.	1

The splash screen says the account is free forever. But to have reminder of events / tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its £3 per month. That's quite misleading. #response to the developer. Thank you for responding. The main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature.... best wishes with the app.	-1

The idea is good, but the app can be made better with some performance optimisation. For example, when I launch the app, it takes at least 3 seconds to synchronize and restart my habit list with the correct status. And all pop-ups only appear with a 2sec delay. Overall I like the idea, by I'm moving onto other habit tracker apps because this kind of gamification isn't for me :) Appreciate the app.	1

The best looking todo app I could find, very complete. Would be the one I use but... Unfortunately sync with Google calendar takes hours, up to a day. The issue seems to be a couple of years old (you can check it in the customer section on their website), and nothing was done to address it, while the competition syncs in seconds. If you don't need Google sync, then it's great. I'm now using another app. Sad.	0

Random ad pop ups that distracts while pulling up a meeting in a hurry. Doesn't parse contacts from email meeting invites into names you can easily add and remove. Is pro worth $6?

The interface is great and I love it overall; however, I'm giving it two Stars because it won't synchronize between my Samsung phone and Ipad, despite being the same account information for each. I emailed their support like about this, and they asked for my login info, but I never heard anything back. This is a huge inconvenience because I put a LOT into the version on my iPad, and I dont, and wont, do it twice for the same application. Once this is fixed I'll happily increase the rating.	-1

"Every update have been a step backwards. All the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so. The last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly (to default ""inbox"" project) anymore, now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project, even though I just want to add quickly to the default inbox. Making the quick add widget useless now. Also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy (monthly cost instead of one time)."	-1

Great concept, but not quick to use. Creating events through Google Calendar takes time, I would like to be able to use without syncing to any calendar. Perhaps add an option to store events locally instead of syncing to outside calendars. And make that process quick and ease Edit: Thank you, I have found that option!	1

I like that the app in simple. I turned off the motivational quotes, so all I see is the calendar. And that's all I need to see! One thing I would add, though, is the ability to add exception so missed days don't count against my streak. One of my goals is a daily activity that I can only do at home. When I travel, I miss those days. But I did it every day I was able (i.e. every day I was home), so it's a bit of a downer to be penalized.	1

"I've tested several tasks apps and this is my favourite. Super simple though effective! The views are just great. Plan by project and execute by due date. Overwhelmed? Add to My Day just what you feel you can accomplish.

I have used this app for years. I have always paid for the premium version. At first, it was my favorite app, but it has gotten steadily worse. Now it is very glitchy. It closes randomly and typically takes up to three minutes to open which is very embarrassing when I'm trying to set an appointment with a customer. It also randomly unchecks completed tasks and reverts to older versions of my schedule. The developers are uncaring and blame my phone (Note 8). I'm looking for a new app.	-1

Been a user of the app for 5+ years. Has been helpful in managing a busy life. Up until recently would have given 5 stars. Three stars because of poor app support. I think I have finally worked out my issue, but disappointed in level and responsiveness of support. Just hope you never need support.	0

Been using it for years and there have been tons of improvements! Great app. Just wish you could choose for notifications to come from top of screen instead of the bottom because many times a reminder pops up while I'm typing and I'll mistakenly dismiss it.	1
10/10 Great app! Let's you keep track of goals and habits daily. It's highly customizable and will send you notifications to remind you of stuff, if you want. Also I really like the message boards, I find them really inspirational. Also, I've been using this app for several months, and it's never asked me to pay anything. And there aren't any ads either. I know that there's a premium version in one of the side menus, but I'm not sure what it does because it already gives you everything you want.	1

My neck hurts a lot.	-1
It's a mess. I add new tasks and tag them. But they will randomly disappear, reappear. And the tags will disappear. Editing and adding them back in doesn't help because once a tag disappears you can't add it back in again. Disappearing tasks is the worst because there's no warning. They're just gone. They're not listed as complete, they just disappear. Sometimes they'll come back but sometimes I have to re-enter them...assuming I remember. I pay for this app, so the fact that the basic functionality of keeping my list intact is random and spotty is unacceptable. It may have something to do with syncing... no idea. But either way, I'm going to use another app because I just don't trust it anymore. These errors seem to be recent, like in the last 3 months.	-1

This App is useless , it works as a notepad with your tasks in it , it does not notify you of tasks you suppose to do. When the time reaches it's silent doesn't pop up even though settings have permitted it to pop up and alert , even a simple alarm clock notified me of what to do .This app Doesn't work .	-1

I originally gave the app 4 stars only because I don't like committing myself to 5. But on reflection I think you deserve full points. I haven't explored all the features yet so will get back to you when I do.	1

"So I forced myself to sit thu the first exercise and I want my 25 minutes back, please? Is this a joke? The devs must be sadomasochistic to develop an app that flashes conflicting phrases such as ""Stay focused"" & ""You can do it!"" with ""Don't look at me!"", ""Stop phubbing"" (l had to look that one up) & ""Put down the phone!"", not that I was using a phone in the first place. Quite extraordinary!"	-1
App no longer supported, data loss likely: Was a great app until I needed to migrate to a new phone. The sync feature never worked, and I lost months of habit data. I tried contacting the developer via the supplied email, but zero response. I used to recommend this app to many people, but I'm done with it.	-1

This app started out great. Everything was so organized and I was happy I had a digital schedule with reminders to carry with me. But it stopped giving me notifications, it also stopped showing my reminders all together. I wanted to uninstall the app for a while because it's never working, but today was the last straw. I had a reminder put for my midterm, but of course since it's such an awful app... it didn't notify me. I missed my midterm. Screw this app, don't download it.	-1

A super-quick response from the dev sorted out my issue with the alarm sound, so now this little app is perfect for me. You can sort your tasks into lists; you can be reminded, by notification or alarm, any amount of time beforehand; you can set a priority for tasks... and probably more that I haven't discovered yet. Now I just need a busier life.	1

Whilst being engaging with its currency system, in how you have to work to personalise your experience, I do have some quarrels. One of these being the similarities in structure between this app and others such as Grammarly. I understand that this is an advertising matter, however it seems to have stolen the feature to double your reward From watching an advert. This I find, encourages both laziness and the dulling of the experience as it feels repetitive. Less help would give more work for us.	0
Love the interface and how easy and helpful it would be, but the alarms I set do not not ring. I gave permissions to this app already, yet it doesn't. Edit: Thank you for letting me know it's a Huawei power saving issue! Are there any work-arounds the power saving mode on Huawei to still allow this app to run? The alarms are very important, without them the app is critically impaired on my device. Haha. Thanks!	0

The app is absolutely amazing, but with the loss of the whitelist feature, I can't set apps to be allowed to switch to. I do *not* want to pay extra for a feature that used to be free. Especially since I use my phone for most tasks through the day and I like having the ability to allow those apps to be opened workout killing the tree. Also, the tree dies when you get a call now, or when replying to notifications, which I used to be able to fix with the whitelist, but I'm just left with a ton of withered trees now.	0

I like this app, I have used it for a while now and it helps. Only reason for 4 stars is that the percentages are frustrating. I managed 122 days straight but it won't change from 98%. I think once you do the full 66 days you should get 100%. Also, would love to be able to highlight a day in the future as a milestone, just different colour so I can say 50, 100 days etc, as a motivator. It's great for a free app. We'll done to the devs on this.	1

I would've liked to use this app but sadly it doesn't seem to recognize European daylight saving time. I've gone through the settings twice. This is a deal breaker I'm afraid.

Honestly I would give it 5 star, since I'm not going to subscribe or anything, but the fact that you need to subscribe just to change the theme (just to change it into dark theme) is deal-breaker, so 3 star it is. I know, you guys also need to make money but for a appearance options need to be paid is a no for me, I get it if it's like new option like color-coding so you can easily sort stuff, things like that.	0
Great in a lot of ways, but a huge drawback is that you can't edit the start date or previous inactivated/activated dates for a habit. So, if you've been doing a habit for a few weeks before you add it to the program, you can't record those two weeks of success in the program. Or, if you intentionally stopped a habit for a time period, but didn't inactivate it during your chosen time off, your percentage is dragged down.	0

Thus far, I'm enjoying this app. I feel absolutely motivated in completing a task; and, staying on track.

i suggest a positive running tab amd also a negative running tab! i love the app and it really makes a difference in tracking my daily habits. the only thing i have found that would make it better is if i could track relapses. this would require it to allow something that i do NOT want to mark for a day amd when it is marked then it would be a negative. this would help responsibility to be accounted for the relapse. i would like these negstives to be separateky counted from the positive marks.	1

I can still use all my apps when I'm using this app. It just gives me a notification to go back to the app, before if I opened Instagram for example it would redirect me to the Forest app but it doesn't do that anymore, therefore the app is useless in my opinion	-1
I really want to use this app, but on my Galaxy S10, the first 2 of the 3 slides in the introduction before logging in, are blank. The character visuals on the character customization are invisible, and on the settings menu, I scroll down and the options start to overlap each other (hard to describe). I will consider reinstalling after the graphical issues are fixed because it seems like a great app, but currently it's unusable for me.	-1

Powerful and simple. The only thing missing is integration with Google calendar, which I used for years, and I do not see any option to migrate either.

I am a Wunderlist native. I do like this move except for one simple thing (as if now), I wish items were added at the top instead of the bottom. I realize I can sort, but I put some lists in a specific order for a reason.	1
It's a good app and being able to route alerts through different sound channels is a great idea. I've found a bug though and couldn't find a way to contact you about it besides here: It's daylight savings today and while timetune has the correct time, for some reason it has pushed forward all my events by one hour. So an event which says it is happening at 6:30 is now on my timeline as 7:30. Hopefully its just for today.	1

"I love the idea of this app. Unfortunately, it is not super user friendly. I've been using it for over a month and it is not very obvious how to complete quests or anything else. (and yes, I have gone through the FAQs) I finally figured out how to hatch eggs, but that's all. It's a pretty clunky app as a ""game"" but it does a pretty good job of keeping me accountable for things. That's the only reason I haven't deleted it. As a ""Gamify your life"" app, I'm not convinced. Hopefully it improves!"	-1

"Very good. I love that flagged emails appear as tasks in this app. I would love an option to bring all of the day before's task to today in one go, instead of having to add them back to ""My Day"" one by one. I love the, ""Planned tasks"" feature, too, so I can see all of the tasks with due dates assigned to them. Lists can be added for different contexts, subjects and people.

Um app muito bom com várias atividades já prontas e com possibilidade de personalização de atividades. A única coisa ruim é a notificação. De você não estiver com o celular na mão ou muito perto de você, você provavelmente não vai ver a notificação (só coloco a vibração). Tirando isso é perfeito.	1
"I like this app but it's so buggy, it has a lot of ""throttling"" while using calendar sync, please fix this. A: I tried to log out and reconnect, this doesn't work. Calendar part is still buggy.

I paid for this app, and it was a wonderful app, easy platform, customisable. BUT, there has been a recent addition of ads. All the time! For an app I have paid for I think this is disgusting. I response to you, no these aren't spam events linked to my phone. I uninstalled this app and used my original paid version of the called app and there are no ads. I was prompted to update to this version a while ago. I thought it was just an ad on from the paid version of business calendar I had.	-1

I am very pleased with this planner. It synchronizes easily with my Google calendars and allows me to stay on my phone and computer with only one entry. The free version does not include search and I have not found to make use of the various to do tabs as well schedule recurring events so I am going to try the paid version and see it meets the rest of my scheduling needs.	1
haha, nice pic looks abit like my school	1
It is an OK app as far as personal entries are concerned and the connected functions of name, time and place. Can not count on it to keep you informed about set Calender Events though as they are set default in 2014. Mothers Day was on the 8th; 2nd Sunday in May this year; not Wednesday the 11th. They can thank my wife for keeping me informed. It is a scheduling app and if the default events are wrong as well as uneditable how confusing will your scheduling be? Keep an accurate calendar handy.	0

Wile installing on my Note 9 it imported / shows promptly each allready existing entry from each of my Calendars. But It does not import / synchronize any new entry ( via any calendar ).

The big CONS to this app: DAILIES tab always shows all of my weekly duties, instead of the DAILY ones. I change this in the filter but once I reopen the app, it switches back to showing EVERYTHING. What's the point of a filter when the app doesn't save it? (Galaxy Note 8) Also, why is there no dark mode? My eyes are screaming at night.	0

"The app is good but the differences between the premium and free version aren't mentioned at the beginning. It is also not possible to start using the app without the ""free trial period"" as far as I have seen. After the forced free trial period I now realize that the sync function which enables you to use pc and and. app simultaneously is indeed a premium function. This seems awful lot like the way Evernote took, I want to buy my apps because I appreciate the work, not because I'm forced into."	-1

This app worked well for a year. Had ads, but I was fine with that. The latest update made the ads much bigger, appearing in the task sidebar instead of banners at the top and bottom. I was annoyed but tolerated it. Then today I got a full screen video add that I couldn't close until it was through. That's too much. Deleted. Reply to reply: I know I can pay to get them removed but I don't want to support a company that pushes an update with full screen video ads you can't close.	-1
As is typical for Microsoft, they took over a wonderful product in Wunderlist, screw it up, and jam it down the throat of their customers. The MS To Do List is harder to use than Wunderlist and lost some features that made it convenient to manage your tasks. I am convinced MS programmers must never use their own products.	-1
but its pretty at least, I think I need to catch some sleep soon though	1
It's pretty nice all things considered, but I have found a few problems with it. mostly the fact that the notifications do not work and by that I mean no matter how many notify alarms I set, none of them go off. I've downloaded this app on several occasions in the past and I've had the same problems each time. The second is that the widget will (quite often) display that I have no tasks when I in fact have about seven on any given day. I'm not taking a star off because of the widget though.	1

Resonse (2/13/20): I know that the free version is not ad-free. The issue that what you have done recently is to force people to watch ads instead of just clicking them away.

I like this app a lot. One thing that stops me from buying pro version is that I desparately need it to export routines to my Google calendar (now I think that it is just possible from Google calendar to TimeTune). That is because the interface of TimeTune is much, much better than Google calendar interface, and I need all my routines in Google calendar in order to sync it with my Google Home speaker, so it can read it out loud every time I ask and remind me even without my phone.	1

Overall i like this app and i am wondering if i should pay for the premium version, because there are serious limitations on the free one (no notes or labels)... But there is one thing that annoys me : the impossibly to control the view settings. It would be better if they had options to change the size of panels and size of fonts and smaller spacing between each entry. It would allow for a better overall view and/or permit to view more things at once and reduce wasted space of the left sidebar	0

It just doesn't work. My family used Wunderlist for years. MS bought them. This app won't sync between users, tells me I'm offline (I'm not) and lost my existing lists. I'm going elsewhere.	-1
This is a good app but the data analysis and visualization is fundamentally broken. The score and success percentage function in that they record the success values for the end of each day and then add that to the database. This means unfortunately that your success percentage never goes above your first day, when if you did the thing, you got 100%. As such, the visualizations are useless. A better solution would be to include rolling means of success percentage by x number of day intervals.	0

When you use the pomo timer, it automatically starts counting down when you hit what task you want yo be working on. There is no longer an icon where you can choose your white noise before starting the pomo and no way to pause the pomo once it starts so you can select your white noise. I would like to be able to select the task I'm working on, select what white noise I want, and then start the pomo; not everything automatically start.	-1

Doesn't open in weekly view even though I have it set to do so. Color scheme could be more attractive, or a greater variety of colors provided to choose from. When you like or dislike a motivational quote, it disappears forever, so if you really like one you should never rate it! Community discussion forum is a nice concept, but there are no dates on the posts, so I have no idea how old they are. Otherwise it's a good tracking app.	0

App is very buggy ! Week view is completely unusable - shows some events twice, and some not at all. Also, it would be nice if there was an option, in month view, to see the names of the events without having to click on every day individually. Fix this and you'll get 5 stars, but without that (especially week view!) the app is useless.	-1

Good app, missing vital a feature - it shows meetings not being attended. I.e. Going = No. That is an obvious feature that stops me from giving a good rating, I must keep company meetings in the calendar that I'm not attending for posterity - not unreasonable I think? So this is a must.	-1

Seems a good app, but can't use the basic functions without paying for premium. Eg can't have a reminder at a certain time of day without premium. Surely the basic function of a reminder app is reminders on a certain day or time. Premium is £36 so expensive, loads of free alternatives out there.....	-1
I'm using the premium version a few days now. I'm not getting any notifications for my reminders. I checked the menu and everything is fine. Is there something you can do to help?	1

I almost never leave reviews but for this transition I have to make an exception. Wunderlist has been my most frequently used App, being in daily use to manage my busy days. The ToDo version is hopeless to use. I like to use a weekly list which no longer exists. It's replacement does not allow drag and drop to different days. Worse, if you manually change the date of a task it doesn't move to the new day. It remains in the original day with a completion different date. Must be fixed!	-1

App not bad but very limited unless you pay. Downloaded this app after reading in the news about it's WhatsApp integration. That is only available if you pay. Without the paid for aspects this application is like any other generic calender app.	-1

I have been using this for a while and found it to suit my needs well. I wanted something where I could see trasks and appointments in a daily view. This accomplished that goal in an easy to read and navigate format. However, there must have been a recent update that has made the ads ridiculously invasive to the point that I no longer want to use this app. I think I will start checking on alternate options.	-1

I was about to jump wholeheartedly into using this app (its integration with Google Calendar being exactly what I'm looking for) but now I see that it has no search feature on Android.

"EDITED - read second paragraph. Hi, not sure if I'm missing out a setting but the app does not display all the events in a day. It makes sense to show only the events in a 12 hr time frame on the clock face, but the list of events should include all tasks of the day -- instead of us having to ""fast forward"" the day until the events appear. I did not mean ""tasks"", poor choice of words on my part. I meant that if I have an event at 9pm today, and the time now is 6am, I will not see this at all. The clock face only shows 12 hrs: this makes sense. The list of events below the clock should probably show events for the whole day, though."	1

You have not made it possible, as far as I can see, to assign certain tasks to separate people inside a list...... When I go shopping with my husband he has his assigned items and I have my assigned items. If you have made it possible to do this then please let me know how to access it. I am not as happy with this app as I was with Wunderlist and I'm sorry to hear that you're getting rid of the perfect app	0

Why do you say that you can disable permissions at any time but then the app DOESN'T WORK AT ALL if you do? Why have an app on your phone that you will never use? I have disabled the Google app on my phone for a reason. It's gone completely psycho generating up to three completely nonsensical events and associated 6 reminders every week. The only way to stop it was to completely disable it. Why do you think I was looking for a calendar app to begin with? Why do you need another calendar app in	-1

I regret using it. Well, the apps itself is fine, I have used it for over 6 months. It's easy to navigate. It's not ideal but understandable to have the export calendar function as a pro feature. But then, my phone malfunctioned and I was unable to access this apps. There is no online syncing or a web version so that I can refer back to. edit: I have try the syncing method in FAQ. Most of my calendars are local calendars which I fail to sync or switch them to Google calendar.	-1

Used to love this app, amazing UI, simple. Definitely one of my favourite, and so helpful. This new UI thought, not for me... Too much clutter and scrolling! Tried to get used to it but its not for me, so it's time to let it go. Useful non the less, so try it, maybe it's your thing! Edit: I don't know how to answer so I'll edit and hopefully it gets trough. If I can get something back, I would like the choice to go horizontal (make it a choice on pro). A bunch of horizontal scrolls is not a problem if instead I have to do a bunch of vertical ones. Looks less intuitive to me. And I can use the go-to option, but I kinda already could and never did. I liked to scroll horizontal, because I liked the view that it gave me, and the side comparison of days on same level.	1

Coming from good old Wunderlist and this one is definitely a noticeable refinement. One feature I'm missing from good old Wunderlist is the ability to manually order tasks (this comes handy at times). In addition it would make sense to create a default reminder on the date of the task if such date is defined. With this couple of additions it's an easy 5 stars for me.	1

Wish I didn`t have to work today.	0
It looked good but it doesn't work. I scheduled simple tasks and it would change the timing. I re corrected to make it right several times. The navigation was difficult. Like I'd want to set a task but then I'd have to say the task was complete so wouldn't be sure it saved. Couldn't just back out to see the task was set correctly. Had to confirm the task was done then undo the task for later which might then change the time to something I never set. 😳	-1

The app is good and in general highly customizable, but it has one flaw: it uses days (24 hours periods) as a basic unit of measure, but it doesn't let you change the default starting hour (midnight). This is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night. I would rate it as a 5 stars app, if I could choose when my day ends and be able to log my dailies properly.	1

I thought upgrading and paying the $8 fee would allow me to use all of the functions of this app. It does not. I Haven't been able to sync any of my devices . Absolutely will not let me add an event. This was a waste of time and money. If I can't add my schedule on my lap top version then there's no point to this app. Plus there's no support or anyone to contact to help trouble shoot or credit me back .	-1

It sorely needs and UNDO (& backup/restore/revert) feature in case we accidentally touch/swipe a circle/bullet which then gets unintentionally deleted immediately (which I find incredibly frustrating). (It also needs a flexible feature to import & export other common text/data formats like CSV, XML, events to & from calendar… not just copy reminders to tasks) If Google fixes all that then I'd give it 5-stars!	-1

WTH?! I used Wunderlist happily for, oh, about 7 years!Complete BS! They make you sign in to an acct to use this. I will NOT BE FORCED to sign in so all my personal info is linked with all my private grocery and to-do list. Microsoft has enough of my info and I have been less than happy with the invasion of Cortana on my laptop. MS help is the WORST (besides Google). So why would I want this co. storing THIS level of my personal life in their database? F no! Deleting this app immediately.	-1

I bought the pro version and like it so far. For now what I'm really missing is the ability to change days from the widget itself, with the left and right arrows, and not only from inside the app. Why wouldn't you enable the left and right arrows to change day as default? Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself. Other than that, the app seems to be very practical. If the ability to swipe from one day to the next day or to the last day from the widget gets implemented, it would be a 5 star app for me. Thanks.	1

I like the app. Have been using it for a few months now, and the widgets plus reminders definitely keep me on track. Only drawback I've found is the inability to sync my profile - always fails with 'sync failed, make sure you have a working internet connection'. Have sent in support request, but so far no response. That aside, the app works well, and I can still use it in 'standalone' mode on my primary Android phone.	1

Inspite of the event or task completed tasks being shown on the list. As per the reminders and their timing auto arrangements of list is not there. The first and most early created event is reflecting on the top rather than time based or priority based.

"Excellent so far, I've been using it for several years. One thing always is an issue though, I can never consistently figure out how to ""sleep"" my notifications if they end up on the quick setting drop down menu.

I have been using the fully unlocked version of this application for over a year. This is a fantastic app! However, it lacks the capability to sync with outlook calendars.

This would be fine if this was the documented behavior of this application. However, subscribed-outlook calendars are selectable from the calendar selection menu...	-1
It displays awkwardly, has backwards date, malfunctions to a point where the widget does not display, has a small central area, has no 1x1 option, has complicated descriptions for functionality that should be easy to understand, but I can buy a widget pallet, which many apps have as standard for free, for $3.

Since I could not change the size of the font internally to the app, I ended up not using it at all and now I am cancelling.	0

Mostly really good, great for sharing tasks between people/phones/desktops, but the widgets on Android keep clearing themselves and have to be re-added to work again, and repeating tasks constantly change the day they alert you on, reminding me the day after or before I set them to. I keep having to edit them back again. Really frustrating. What's the point in a daily reminder if it keeps changing to try and alert you the day before it existed? Edit: and again, anytime there's a clock change!!!	0

Nice but please give option to add different time intervals for habits. For example I want to develop habit of drinking water and want the reminder to come at multiple particular times a day. The app allows only one specific time for the reminder, so please add the mentioned feature.	1

Tried a few different apps over 2 years but always came back to TickTick. Works well for me, aligns to me needs and I find it intuitive. I'd recommend, especially since it offers a lot of features which are premium in others apps. Unsolicited advice to anyone looking for a to-do app: there is no app that works best, no one-size-fits-all. Unfortunately you need to test a bunch and decide which works best for you.	1

Overall, it's pretty fantastic. Planting flowers and trees - and not wanting them to die - is good motivation to Accomplish Things without the phone. Sometimes there's an issue with notifications cancelling the timer, but that doesn't happen as often anymore. Looking forward to seeing what new plants show up in the app next! And the customer support team are great about replying if you have issues transitioning to a new phone.	1

You receive satisfying rewards for staying off your phone, building positive reinforcement for off-screen time. It has an adjustable time scale which corresponds to the reward you receive, so it can be as convinient as you desire. I love it, it has really helped me so much with getting past hard work deadlines, and just focusing on certain tasks in general. 11/6 much recommended👍	1

The app hasn't synced for nearly 9 months despite being a premium user. The support team haven't acknowledged my email. It's a good concept but they've failed to make it work and don't provide customer support. Check other reviews. Go to play.google.store on a web browser. Select My Account and go to order history. Select the ... and it offers you an option to request a refund. That should get the developer to either repair it or take off the premium services it is falsely selling.	-1

I came across from Wunderlist and it does everything I need it to do except for one really annoying feature - on Wunderlist when you added a new item you had the option for it to go to the top or bottom of the list. I always want my newest entries to go to the top (especially in very long lists) as they are the things I want to action first. Include a simple option to allow this and your app will do everything Wunderlist did and I will be a happy man!	1

This is a step down from Wunderlist. Before deprecating Wunderlist in favor of this app, it should atleast have been brought to parity.

"""Microsoft To Do"" keeps my wife and I on the same page! We use it, increasingly, to help us plan and track routine tasks or specific projects around the house, through shared lists!

The ""attach file"" option is a big bonus!"	1

I don't have to be overwhelmed by how much I have to do. I just take 1 task at a time. There's even a Promo timer embedded to help me stay on track.	1

UI needs major improvements. The only app I believe which give quantitative habits also (not just binary) like 4 pages to read. Statistics based on that can be improved but nevertheless kudos for the idea. This is only app which gives upto 7 habits in free version, so keeping it. else due to UI would have rejected long time back. Current apps in market give 3 or 5 max.	0

Ticktick throws a lot of functions and features into the app, almost the whole kitchen sink. It has some very good and strong features, specially related to reminders, recurring reminders, some ability to recognise natural language dates etc. However it needs to improve MUCH more in search abilites. Except for tags and list names search terms do not show up as you type. Search for tasks with multiple word combinations in the task title does not work. Robust solid search is still sorely lacking	0

I like the way this app is so intuitive to use but it has just been updated and there are dots that can be selected. Generally on websites these are used for options, you select one then do something with it but in Todoist when an option is selected it deletes that task. It is very confusing and counter-productive. Swiping the task was much more intuitive. I don't know why this has been changed when it worked fine as it was. As the saying goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it!	0

Love the program and it's definitely an improvement over Google Calendar. Just the easy moving back and forth between dates using the 'go to' feature is a huge plus in my book. It does have some short comings that are irritating to me at least. I use my calendar to keep track of my to do lists. I save them in the Description field. First off the editing features such as bolding, underlining, line numbering, etc don't appear anywhere unless like in my case you accidently discover them by doing a couple of steps of bizarre gymnastics. Once found I loved the features. However the first thing that is annoying is that if you have a long list of things that go past one screen you have to keep scrolling down to access those features. Would be nice if there was a button or tab that would open a stationary bar at the top or a floating window that moves with the screen. Second issue is definitely a software bug having to do with the line numbering. Once a line numbering list has been established and you want to go back to add a new line or change the priority by moving things up and down the system does odd things.	0

Moreover, don't know if this is my problem, I can't see reminders. I see them inside the calendar app but not here. Hope they will improve so I can finally give a sweet 5 stars, the idea itself is brilliant!	0

I have been using this app for a while, really trying to get to grips with it but I've come to conclude that it's not me. If you feel like you need less complexity in your life them this probably isn't for you as this adds a new system that you have to get to grips with and plus the gamification aspect can be quite destracting and finnecky. I think if this were to ever be useful for me it would need a separate environment for tasks, habits and dailies.	0

This app is wonderful! I love that it has an option for numerical input each day. It is also great that there are both individual tasks and continuous habits, as previously I have had to use two separate apps for this. I did pay for the premium version, but I like that the app still functions effectively even if you have the free version. I would love to have a visual of my progress in each habit for the past week, but that is the only recommendation I can make. Overall this app is perfect!	1
but i`m talking to the boy first	0
"So, 2 (almost 3) years ago I purchased the pro version of this app. At the time, that unlocked access to all present and future ""pro"" aspects. Now, however, after a long list of changes, the fact that I have already paid for this app and been using it for years doesn't seem to matter. I'm now constantly being asked to repurchase a product I already own. To add insult to injury, features that used to be standard (drag & drop) are now a pro feature, that I should already own, cost $6.99 and up."	-1

I really like the idea and it does help me with staying focused, but reminder notifications don't always pop up. It's also a bit slow at times when loading a new screen, and some screens look a bit dated but it's fine. Anyways I love the feature of being able to plant real trees, I'm looking forward to plant one!	1
The app itself is very good. Nevertheless, there's a problem: I can't seem to make it work on my Sony Smartwatch 3. In fact, as soon as I install the app on my phone, the watch face appears on the watch but after a while (about a minute) it suddenly disappears.	0

First thing I did when I installed the app was disable notifications and yet I still get constantly spammed with notifications all day long. That aside, the app is poorly made. UI is very buggy. Chat functions are glitchy and don't update mezsages correctly. Sometimes the main ui responds to nothing. You can switch tabs and nothing changes till you close and open the app again. Almost all fun and worth while content is locked behind a paywall or subscription.	-1

ABSOLUTELY DO NOT UPGRADE TO PREMIUM. It does not work. It does not sync. The developer does not respond. Google Play will not give a refund. The frees app is flexible. You can track yes/no and count per day habits. The count per day can be any criterion you want, minutes, calories, quantity.	-1

I do enjoy this app, but it looks and functions terribly on anything but a mobile aspect ratio. I'm attempting to use this for ChromeOS, on a Pixelbook, but the app is unable to run in windowed mode or resize in landscape mode properly. I am also a pro-user, but the app lacks pro functions. There is no pause feature to be found on either the Android or Chrome extension and deleting records costs an additional 60 coins.	0
Revamping my recording studio today and adding some nice high end outboard gear...very exited!	1
The whole point of a to do list is to remind you to get things done with the help of a numeric badge count. Since they can't be bothered to add this feature, the app, is useless to me. You just loss a potential lifetime user who would have even paid a subscription to have that one feature. Other apps can offer badge counts through launchers such as Evie. Don't give me the excuse that Android is not developing this feature.	-1

The most user friendly to do list I've ever had, and I've tried a few! I love the colour coding of each list, the push notifications which you can snooze for various amounts of time are spot on. It's definitely worth trying this if you want to get organised with ease. Now I've been using it for a couple of weeks, I have one thing that would be useful, it would be even more awesome if the snooze options included something specific such as 'tomorrow 8am', 'tomorrow 6pm'. Still an amazing app!	1

As a Gamer This Makes Life Fun You can make a long of lists of your daily life and gain XP and rewards.

This app seems useful. Regretfully, I am going to uninstall it. It is too pushy, and keeps reminding me to use it.

I changed it back, thinking I am uninstalling if this happens again. It happened again. This morning I noticed it changed back to Any.do in the place where I want the transit app. Goodbye Any.do.	-1

I REALLY wish I was spoiled!	-1
This app is great! But i have some suggestions that would even better improve the quality of using the app. for example, something like being able to edit the tasks widgets to show 'due soon' instead of just tasks for that day for even better planning.	1

Разработчик исправил ошибку, которая не давала начать и оказалось, что приложение довольно хорошее, но:Режим испытания - бред. Кто-то его использует по фану и исход решает рандом. Кто-то пиарит свой ютуб канал.Так же, нет приоритизации сложности целей.Т.е кто -то поставит сложной целью написать диплом, а кто -то сходить в магазин.Дорого,в игровой валюте, стоят квесты. За неделю так и не получил. Хотя целей было много. Удалил его, так как мне не подходит дизайн для офиса. Но это уже особенность	1

it is good I like being able to add sub task lists for each task and categorise each. I would really like if there was a pre-made to do today/ tasks I want to focus on category that one comes up as soon as you open the app like a front page + visible calendar 30 day layout one can schedule tasks to, making it easier to plan out tasks systemically	1

Great app, I only have one complaint: The Tavern system doesn't work. I went on vacation and knew I wouldn't be able to complete my dailies or even open the app for that matter, so I entered the Tavern thinking I was safe for the couple weeks I'd be gone. I just reopened the app and it told me I had died twice, took all of my gold, two of my items, and decreased two levels. Honestly considering deleting the app now, as I had over 100 gold saved and lost a piece of rare equipment	0

I paid for premium on this and it is by far the best todo app I've used. The only thing keeping it from getting a 5 stars for me is that it needs an option to set what time your day ends or when the day starts. Because i usually end my day at 2am and by that time tasks become overdue and karma points are not credited for the previous day. Nonetheless, great app 👏🏼	1

The app is great for the most part, i just wish that the 'notification option' for tasks would actually alert me. No alarm or even a pop-up message. I got this to help me remember to take care of certain things due to memory issues, but it's not gonna be of any help if i can't even remember i have the app. Please fix the alarm notification system.	0
I`m so sick, it`s ridiculous.	-1

Is a very unique to-do list which keeps you complete all task. The only problem I found with this app, is that sometimes is very buggy. You cannot use this app offline, and you cannot sync your calendar with this. Overall is very recommended. Is like a game	1

Had to switch from Wunderlist. To Do lacks functions which make Wunderlist so great. Importing worked well, but sharing previously shared lists required me to make a new 'personal' account - this wasn't an issue before. All is set up now and the app feels limited still in themes and settings. Most of all, why switch? Why not just rename Wunderlist to say 'Microsoft Wunderlist'?	-1
Though it started bland sometime ago, To-Do is getting better and better. I find myself using it more and more as it is very convenient for me in my Microsoft Ecosystem. Developers are also responding well for user feedback and ideas for improvements.	1
Good night all, 15 miles of trails with 7 peeks to climb in the morning, fun times ahead	1

This evening the app crashed & then did not open at all.

Love it! Would like to see a few more details in the graphs. It would be handy if you could scroll through the weeks smoothly instead of one week at a time. The dark version of the app should be the standard imo, it looks cooler ánd it saves power! I'd love to have a timer as an option to measure the amount of time spent on a habit. Thinking of meditation, breathing exercises.	1

This app would be great if they would just stop locking people out of premium. This has happened with several users for months and still not fixed.

Just use one of the many other habit trackers.	-1

Easy to set up and daily tracking is very simple. Visual display is great. If a habit is set for every other day, or with some other gap in between, the app shows a chain with open circles rather than solidly-colored circles. Likewise, if the goal is a specific number of minutes or repetitions, it color-codes the entry differently depending on whether you met or did fewer reps than the goal. Only using the free app for now but plan to upgrade.	1

"I really like this app, it's one of the best reminder apps there is. However the new custom notifications are horrible! It sticks out like a sore thumb. You have to manually set between white or black background, which means that they don't automatically switch with Android 10 dark mode. They're also not black, but grey which makes them look ugly next to other notifications. Title and time also don't line up with other notifications. Plus it says ""a min. ago"", which is only accurate if I look at my phone immediately. And it turns on the screen when the notification comes in, even if it's in my pocket. This is a great app, but the recent update is one of those 'if it ain't broken don't fix it' moments. I really hope you consider going back to standard Android notifications, or at least provide an option between custom or standard. I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars if that happens."	-1

As someone with ADHD, organizational tools are a necessity and this is one of the best. I say that having tried just about every well rated organizational app in the app store. That said, this is obviously still in development. The web version is missing many important aspects. However new features are coming out regularly and the team is very responsive. Once a few more features are up to par (namely the website and the smart lists) I'll be changing this to a 5 star reveiw and paying for pro.	1
Love this app! Just wish I could use it on my surface pro as well as my phone.	1
Actually... It's pretty darn good. Yes you pay a subscription for full functionality but if you have a lot of projects and other stuff to track it's worth it. I also have to say that I love that there is a nice Chrome extension/widget (whatever)... so nice to be able to work on the desktop as well. Yes OneNote is good but honestly TickTick is much much better for tracking tasks with due dates IMO. Cheers!	1

I like the app so far. One issue is like someone else said, why do you have to pay for the app before doing a free 14-day trial? Second, why don't the notifications pop up where I can see them?

After I grow a plant, when it gives the option of double reward by watching a video, I click on double reward. And it shows a video which I watch also, after that the screen goes black, nothing happens, and I had to close it, when I try to open again ,it says forest app is not responding.And when I click OK for that, and open the app, it opens, but with only half reward, there is no double reward given , even after I watch the advertisement video, what kind of cheating is this? Please fix it.	0
If possible please add more advanced equipments and more powerful bosses so that it does not get boring after sometime. There is no purpose to collect pets if they are only for cosmetic purpose.

the app itself is a wonderful idea, but the interface and functions need a lot of work in my opinion. it took me so long to figure out how to set up a habit, and i still don't understand how to use a task groups or steps. I gave up and came back to my previous tracker because it was too complicated and time consuming to learn how to use this one. Anyway, I will definitely retry after an update :)	0

I have questions that i would like to have answered and i have emailed numerous times with no reponse back. They say dont write negative reponses to this app without contacting us first. I did email for answers but no one will answer my questions. My questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people. So this could be a great app but service is terrible. Which instead of getting 4 or 5 stars im giving 2 should be 1 but app is good the ones behind the app are bad just want to take peoples money and then laugh at us by not helping	-1
It's useful but it doesn't fully sync the events, tasks, and notes between devices. It's a huge inconvenience. Besides that I still love the app.	-1

Compared to version 1 - poor. Allows for editing one entry of (for example) a weekly appointment, but rather than edit the one instance (as you think you are doing) it creates a new one, so you have a double entry, the original which you can't delete, even after synching. If you've set weekly appointments and one is cancelled, you should be able to edit that one instance without creating a duplicate. I've had this installed for some time now, thinking that the developers would resolve these problems, but although the app has regular 'updates', nothing has changed. Drag and drop defaults to copy, imo should be 'move' by default. If you change an appointment it changes, not duplicates. Also the interface and look (big text and colours) looks like a children's calender, while the original version actually looked quite professional.	-1

This is the closest app I've found since my last upgrade & lost a similar app. Best thing about it, it's VERY user friendly & everythings right at my fingertips. I'm still getting used to it, but loving it so far! I have only one change I'd like to see. I love how I can change the arrangement in my lists, could you make it so I can change the arrangement of my catagories as well. Thank you & I hope I don't loose this one when it comes time to upgrade!	1

Great concept, but really quite bad execution. With so many bugs even in the new player introduction it feels like an early access, not v2.2 of anything. Surprised to learn that it's been in public release for 4 years now. I would be ashamed to make or spend money from any transaction within this game. I'm not usually this harsh, and I hope none of the devs take this review personally, but get it together. Needs a major QOL & UX overhaul before I would consider the concept v1.0 complete.	-1

5 years after acquiring Wunderlist, Microsoft has still failed to replicate the great to do list manager. Critical features missing include natural language support for due dates (not available for Android or desktop), grouping of lists, and email notifications for reminders. The app has come a long way but man, what a shame it's taken 5 yrs and they still haven't even matched the old app and now they're sunsetting WL. That's 5 yrs which could have been used to enhance an already great app.	0

"Yes, I started with a 3 star review, but I did drop it down to a 1 star review. Why? The developed asked me to send a screenshot of a spontaneous mismatch between what I typed and what the app accepted as my task. As per every ""busy"" developer, he requested for me to email so that he quietly resolves the problem. I will not do so; he may take off my review, but every user be warned: You may retype your tasks with this app only for the program to clear it when exitting the edit menu."	-1

A capable calendar. My main grumble is that it notifies me of calendar events after they have passed. Sometimes a day or so later.

You get what you put into this and you don't have to pay a penny if you don't want to.

The app is great for the use, however I am giving it 3 stars. If I make a new event and change the colors, or add more than one reminder, these changes erase after I create the event. This results in me having to make those changes twice for them to be saved. Very annoying and inconvenient. Edit: I add the events on my phone for a synced calendar. The wifi connection is always stable as well.	0
Such a great app for reminders etc. All the functionality and features I would like to have seen in the now redundant Cortana for Android are in this app. Nice UI, great features and a pleasure to use. Would like to see integration with calender and a feature to add travel such as flights etc but in the meantime still an excellent app.	1

Hi. Long time TickTick user. Unfortunately the app still has big issues with subscribed LOCAL calendars. Recurring events from the local calendar are doubled in the list view and have been for a long time now. The last time it worked properly was in 5.2.1. I notified you guys a long time ago, but it hasn't been fixed. I finally tried Any.Do and it works properly with my LOCAL calendar so it seems that I will be giving them my subscription money this year.	0

does not seem to work with google calendar, I see no reason to give them my payment info for a free premium trial. // I managed to add the google calendar. it took all the events, bur not the reminders in calendar . I still won't use this, as it seems to be a replacement interface but I like the google display better. I don't need to pay this much for few benefits to me. I have not found anything that I like yet, either.	0

No longer able to add note to Todoist quickly using Google and Note-to-self. Yes you can do it but it takes 60 seconds instead of 10 seconds.

Very simple, good for keeping you away from your phone. Also planting trees is the best for the environment because plants keep animals alive and animals keep plants going by herbivores eating plants then pooping out seeds and predators keep herbivores in check so they don't eat to many plants, it's a symbiotic relationship.

I came from Wunderlist as I got an email said it was shutting down on March 6th. I was expecting a sub par experience, having to re-enter all of my tasks and data.

Love TickTick, it's almost perfect! I'd love to see the following features added: • Subtasks within subtasks (like todoists) • Option to assign repeating tasks to repeat after completion rather than due date. (I have an automatic cat feeder that lasts five days then I need to be reminded, but if I postpone a day or two and then check it off it sets to repeat five days after the original due date instead of after I check off) • Option to configure inbox behavior (include tasks from other lists)	1

Absolutely love this app and have been using it for months. Different lists in different screens via the widget. Unfortunately the widgets have become unresponsive and now I'm looking for a new app. Will this be fixed ? Using Huawei p20 pro mate for reference Edit: I have reinstalled the app, taken the app off battery saver mode. When I reinstalled it is still the same, clicking on the widget does nothing, can't add tasks at all!	0

I like how it allows me to set any number of reminders, minutes/hours/days/weeks in advance either by push notification or email. But many little bugs pepper this app. The calendar view will bug out and not map to the selected month from time to time. The location field tries to be smart by giving you a 'maps like' autocomplete, but this is annoying when you just want 'gym'. For some reason the first letter of an event name isn't registered by autocorrect, so 'Event' turns to 'venting'.	0

Please add a calendar. It would be great to have outlook calendar sync to it. Having to use outlook calendar & microsoft to do is a bit of a pain. All in one app would be perfect. Some people need to actually see their calendar, so planned and tasks don't really work, although it is a great idea.	0
No money... and No Car...	0
Honestly it's perfect but theres just. One thing. I really wish you could set a habit for 'complete X times a week', it would be so useful. I have yet to find an app that is this good, but that is the only shortcoming. Please add this! I mean of course you dont have to but it would be amazing.	1

So, I really like this app! Probably one of the best planner apps out there, but I ended up uninstalling it because it kept asking to pair with my Google account, and the pop-up was rather aggressive. The cancel button didn't work and it would pop up after every single action. Even after going to the settings to try to sync it with my account, I didn't see a way to sync it! I do really love this app, it's great! But that pop up just ruined it	0

This app would get 5 stars as it is great for capturing and managing tasks. However due to major flaw it gets 1 star. I have accidentally deleted long detailed lists when trying to delete a task, and there is no deleted item recovery feature which means I have lost work. The notification feature does not clearly differentiate between TASK LIST and TASK allows this to happen. If fixed, this would be a fantastic app, but these flaws means using this app results in rework and frustration for now.	-1

"It's just okay. I much preferred Wunderlist. I'd give a 5 star rating if Microsoft To-Do added new items to the top of the list, not the bottom, and allow you to move any item to the top by pressing the ""star"" on that item, similar to Wunderlist. Needless to say, I'm gonna be using this app a whole lot less than I had used Wunderlist, until this is fixed. It's a huge inconvenience for me to have to keep dragging each new item to the top of my lists, which tend to be VERY long."	0

It does not give me the ability to NOT use 24-hr time format. I'm not in the military or a factory so I prefer regular time format. Doesn't matter how many times I uncheck the 24-hr setting, it sticks. Fix that and I'll rate higher and maybe even purchase a yr subscription.	-1

A nice little app. Liked most aspects of it... But had to uninstall because of just one feature - reminder. I dont know why would someone decide to ship this very basic feature as a premium one! If an app like this reminds me after two days in an email that I have overdue tasks than there is absolutely no purpose of using such an app.	-1
cool visual but doesn't work the way I thought it would. I don't like organizing my hour-by-hour tasks through my calendar because it clutters it up and makes me miss my important events. I wanted to use this app thinking that it would allow me to plan my dialy tasks just through the app. But every time I want to plan an event it forces me to do it through my calendar which I don't like. good concept, but I don't see a reason to use it since it just wants me to use my calendar anyway.	-1

I love the fact that most of the important features are free, it makes it easier to work with my team without them using premium like I do, and they learn it easily	1

Really awesome app!!! Its definitely easier than other habit tracking apps I've tried, and better designed too. I get a lot of use out of it, so I purchased the full version. If you're trying to keep track of multiple things at once, especially with the goal of remembering to do things, this will help. I have horrible memory due to health issues so I sometimes forget to do basic things, and this keeps me on track.	1

So quick and handy. A proper list app with no annoying features	1
To do list works good but it is no idiot proof. Developer needs to add more walk through instructions at start when the app is downloaded. When people commit on issues- the developer replies offended- but the developer did not make a idiot proof way of solving these problems that a newbie with little patience would have- instead they lash out - its not the user's fault- its the developer fault for not understanding the concept of idiot proofing a sound product- face it-people don't read!	1

Nice material design is to very old. Sound tons of TODO managers with beautiful UX and interesting UX. Since 2015 not namy changes. New releases is almost empty. Feels like this product develop single developer. I whanta a customizible icons for every project. Rich graphics with analytics, not single karma. More actions or favorite projects in long press shortcuts. Manual sorting favorite projects. More functions when I types a text. More performance, limit in 300 tasks per proje its nothing	0

Don't waste your money! Instead, to get a free trial you have to select business even if you aren't a business. Then you can still experience the miserable support experience of 6 days of radio silence (and it has now been 48 Hours of radio silence on my urgent ticket). The app/system/api is fairly good, but I would expect better bug support if they claim to have a business or even premium plan.	-1
Burnt the **** out of my hand today.	-1
The app is excellent; simple, streamlined, functional to-do list. However, the newly redesigned widget gives me a heck of a lot _less_ control. How do I select and reschedule a group of tasks? How do I open the app from the widget (so I don't need both the widget and an icon)? If I wanted to do complex editing, I could easily open the app, and the widget could do things the app couldn't. Give it back!	1

Can you give an option to set up timer for every task like 10 minutes or so, to make us more efficient?

Hey, Thank you SO much for the #followfriday. I failed miserably to get a list together this week	0
I would give this app 5 stars but I am beyond frustrated with how slow it is to open. I pay the subscription for premium, and I love all the options in the app. But it literally takes 5 to 10 minutes for the app to open, unless there is a notification in my notification bar that I can open the app with. This would be annoying even with a free app, but to pay for a slow app that takes ages to open is ridiculous. In the 2 or 3 years that I've used it this has never been fixed with any upgrade.	0

I've been using Todoist Premium for just over one year now. I think I've tried nearly every todo app out there.

Dec. 5, 2019 Update Moved from 5 stars to 2 for the reason below: I've had this app for about half a decade. The last couple years have been irritating. I add sub tasks. When I go back to the tasks, the sub tasks aren't there. I wish there was a save button as a cue and confirmion that the subtasks are saved. Not sure how long I could forgive the app until I just use another one altogether. Please address subtasks staying in the next update. Thanks! Was 5 stars for the longest time Awesome!	-1

I can't say enough good things about the app and the dev and support teams. Super stable, lots of great features, and the most responsive support team I've worked with personally or professionally.

Terribly unethical company! They bought the old task management system I was using, Gtask, which I'd bought I lifetime subscription for, then they took away the automatic sync feature making it useless and told me to download the premium tick tick version of the app never telling me that in doing so it would automatically opt me into a premium $3 a month subscription just to get the features I'd already bought. How google allows this type of predatory behavior is beyond me.	-1

I really like the app/online portal but having everything in one does me no good w/o push notifications & I wish this had a widget so I didn't have to open the app to look at everything.i paid for this & I don't feel like I got my investment back as I maybe use the app once in a blue moon. It looks great but it just doesn't work to what I feel is it's full protein. I hope you add this & don't make me pay for it.	-1

so did you watch? I`d forgottenmost of it, enjoyed re-seeing it, but paying for it today, my face doesnt bounce back anymore	1
Excellent idea but doesn't really work as intended. All I do is use the app when I know I definitely won't need my phone and obviously this isn't what it was designed for. I'm not using my phone less at all. Really the tree's should be continuously planted and then when you use your phone the current tree growing dies as this will put people off using there phone if they see that there is only several minutes left for the current tree to finish growing.	-1

Good app for daily planning.	1
Edit: I use comments to add reminders about what I'm specifically planning to do to complete each task day by day, like grocery lists and assignment titles. I would really like to be able to add comments for just one cycle of the routine and have them disappear after the week restarts. I thought it might be useful to have this function on the timeline page rather than the routine edit screen, which seems to only be useful for permanent comments. I hope this makes sense!	1
My graduation day... And i feel like a failure...	0
I am hating the experience now, this app was so great untill it started missing on my tasks reminders and its crazy i couldn't get a very important task done that i put a reminder to here, and i have allowed tick tick all the functions it needs but this reminder thing, its pissing me off, please get it fixed.	0
mee too it`s looks amazeeeeeee	1
Great good tracking with work and lifestyle	1
Excellent Calender Supplement! - I've been using TickTick along side my long term Callander (Google Calender) as a planner for my daily tasks and University Timetable. And it's been nothing short of amazing, life changing might sound like a stretch but it's helped me a tonne when it comes to getting stuffz done. - Only thing I'd ask for is more options or a separate way of planning things like a university timetable to make it faster to add classes etc.	1
No but I just checked and got it LOL. You are ok! I went live for a few minutes and everything is fine.	1

I love the idea but there are syncing issues. Events take forever to show on the graph regardless of whether i entered them in the sectograph app or my google calendar. They show up in my google calender almost automatically regardless of the same. Also i think 12 hour clock makes it tricky to read since the switch from am to pm is in the middle of the day. I have something starting at 12:30 and i cant see it on the sectograph but there is a little arrow at that start time with the first letter of that event and nothing else. It's confusing.	-1

Update: I have been using Forest for about 6 months now and still love it. I just want to say how much I appreciate the Forest team listening to feedback and providing amazing customer support. Thank you!	1

Guys you created a great app that I'd been using for years, but the latest update is weird. Modal views when selecting a single task (WHY do I need it instead of previous submenu for rescheduling??), no ability to choose multiple tasks (only by top menu - select tasks), strange icons.. That all makes me really sad. Rolled out to the previous friendly Todoist :(	-1

Would've been 5 stars but the new full size ads make efficiency impossible.

As a long time user of Wunderlist, this new replacement fails at the single most important thing next to holding taks: remind the user of said tasks. If a task comes up as due, I expect it to stay in notifications until I clear the task. Instead, To Do decided there's a time limit on how long a reminder stays on your notifications which means it isn't reminding you anymore which forces you to remember to open the app to see your tasks. This completely defeats the purpose of a reminder.	-1

This could be an awesome app. It has great potential except for a few flaws that end up making it a super irritating app. I have reported these issues to the app's tech support several times only to get lame responses with no resolutions. The latest being that when items are entered into a category in this app, the app for some reason resorts the sequence of items in my list automatically. I put these items in the list in a certain order for a reason. I have other issues, but no moreroomher	-1

after the latest update, there seems to be some problem with this app. sometimes, when i try to press the button 'plant', nothing happens, not even when i click on the 'three stripes' button then a notification will be sent telling me that the app has stopped working. after reopening the app a few times, the problem persisted. plus, after the update, sometimes i can't write description about the tree that has been planted.the sunflower i planted was shown in the notification, but not in the app.	0
(I am a premium user) This is a great To-do app : tasks, habits, tags, subtasks, timer, however it lacks things that I use on a daily basis, for example: integration with Google calendar or its own calendar (to add events not tasks Edo Agenda did a great job), I wish tags could have different color so that I can distinguish them just by looking at the color, I wish it had other features like project column where you can manage a whole project (ex: trello), Integration with Google Assistant, etc.	0

Some nice features here. Their approach really set it apart from the other I've tried so far. It's a strong contender as a Wunderlist replacement. The only reason I am still not confident on a switch is their Wear integration. It's terrible! The app doesn't listen to the watch at all. I've tried completing and snoozing and it does nothing. The watch app can only add tasks, so the screenshots they're sharing here are DECEPTIVE. I also wish I could hide completed task, instead of deleting.	0

I've just installed this app and will definitely play with it in the next few weeks. It really looks nice and really structured! So far my only surprise is that there's no female icon for the person. Only nuns or dancers, but not a simple female icon that doesn't do anything - just stands. Hello, is this app exclusively for men or is the icon hidden somewhere?	0
im sure the pro version is great but it didn't keep my interest long enough	0
The best. Extremely easy toggle view/hide of your different calendars direct from the month view, ability to create new Google calendars (which you can't do on standard Google calendar), exceptional customization so the app/widget can always match your phones theme, etc etc. Took me about an hour to decide 100% that I will purchase pro, if for no other reason than to say thanks, but the features and look are amazing	1

awww I`ll let you off - but you`d better be there for my next 30th! XD	1
This app could be five stars to me. what is stopping me is the confusion on knowing just what tasks to do or not to do. There's a confusing list of tasks that show up at the bottom and if I did not do them the day before or not click them, they just show up there. If I delete a task from the calendar on accident what do I do? the calendar should be completely removed cuz it's worthless. I think tasks should have some sort of streak function or show how many times you have done it in a row.	0
Great concept and very well executed but the app doesn't close correctly and leaves its loading screen open over my home screen so I can't use my phone until I reset.	0

Update: Thank you for the info! It does what I want:) I have been using this app for about a month. I was excited to see I can separate my to-do list into today, tomorrow, someday etc., as this feature I use to prioritise tasks, which is what I really wanted from the app. Unfortunately it keeps moving all the tasks back into today, which makes it kind of pointless to separate them in the first place :( Please fix this or I'm on the hunt for another to-do list organizer.)	1

Really unimpressed that I cannot get notifications unless I subscribe to premium. I can set up memos on my Google calendar & be reminded for free. Why would I pay for that with an app? Without notifications I'll have to remember to check what needs done, where I'm at, etc. I also found it difficult to figure out how to navigate & use what little was included in the free version.

I would have reported this as a bug within the app, but I found another bug when trying to do that. First one: when submitting a bug or feedback, it does not pass through the 'To' address into the email, so I'm not sure where to send it to. Second one: when editing a habit, daily or to-do text field, the keyboard pops up and disappears. A workaround on this (for my device) is to rotate the phone landscape. Using pixel 3. Otherwise, a very good app!	1

"I am very bad at just starting something and staying with it for a decent amount of time, or at least enough to get it done. This really really helps me in that aspect because I can set reminders, I got the fancy version, that will ping at me whenever I want them to to tell me to work on stuff. Also, every time I look at my little baby tree growing, I kno ""okay I just have this much longer and then I can take a break"" and honestly that is helping me. It is very cute, and user-friendly. 10 / 10"	1

Very useful	1
It's good overall. It has a variety of cute options for trees. I had some issues with an alarm I'd forgotten about going off from another app & causing a tree to die unless I watched an ad. It takes a long time to get enough coins to buy other trees. There isn't a formula available to estimate how long it would take. Discouraging. I liked the idea that was posted about having animals get drawn to healthy forests over time. I wanted pro several times, but don't trust myself with whitelist.	1

Absolutely terrible. I have a 30 something list of daily tasks to keep track of that are set to repeat. It was very tedious & time consuming to set up with in the first place, but after several days at random points some items would not renew. Not all at once and no discernible pattern as to the tasks it stopped renewing. They show that they are still supposed to repeat daily and they were last checked off several days ago, and will not show up on the list for today. 0/5 stars	-1

As great as this app is there is no way to turn off the annoying popups within it. 'rate us', 'congrats 10 days in a row' really? I can see the result. Please add an option to turn off all popups within the app.	0

Why do you get rid of things after making users use to it?? What happened to the press and hold to multi select? Why can't I type 'tomorrow' and click backspace to remove the auto calendar add like I was able to before the update. Thanks for the new features but don't take out the old ones, or at least add an option in the settings to keep things the same	0

It's very easy to accidentally complete tasks and the only way to undo an accidental completion is behind a pay wall. Instant one star	-1

EDIT: Even just an option for the horizontal interface would be great! Thank you for taking my review into consideration! Please please please! Bring back the old horizontal interface. Or at least have an option for it. I used to absolutely love this app and would have rated it 5 stars anyday. But now I find it quite useless..

To begin with I already loved this app because it's aesthetically pleasing very easy to use and all in all just keeps me in check with the things I want to keep up with in my life, I was having issues with my phone so I had to reset and when I try to log back in I didn't have any of the data and I had purchased premium and I didn't have that anymore and I reached out to the support team and they were able to completely help me and merge my account so that I had all my data again and my premium again with no issue within just a few hours they are amazing and I highly recommend this app!!!	1

Great app in the beginning. But once you start skipping days, the notifications become insulting shaming words. For example, calling me a couch potato. Which I am not. So dumb. What expert would ever say that insults are motivational? Almost none. I'd rather use an app based on the principle of kindness, not shaming.	-1

Overall a decent Todo app. It does have some things or desperately needs. 1) why can't I see the event time in the list. I can see the day but not the time. 2) why can't I sort by time? Again, I can sort by date but I can't look at the list and see what's coming next	1

The widget doesn't update with the system time, often stuck until I interact with it, greatly impacting usability. I have locked the app to not be closed in recents, and a fix to this issue will change my rating. I did pay to customize the clock face, and it's far better than the default choices though.	-1

the app is great and i honestly love it, until recently. now when i want to plant a tree, the app stops, unless i'm connected to the internet. also when i successfully plant a tree while using the app offline, the tree doesn't save and the app stops. please fix this as soon as possible and i will rate this 5 stars!!! edit: wow, after the new update the app doesn't stop, but you can't plant a tree, online nor offline. congrats. edit: it's fixed!!	1

Fundamental problem in their development cycle...force users to update, but the value to the consumer doesn't have a feedback mechanism prior to forcing the update. Is there not a beta program with participating users? Todoist, that's what you need to fix.

"This is a super cool and helpful app. I love it. My only criticism is that it could be a bit more user friendly... it's easy to set up habits you want to DO (drink 8 glasses water per day) but harder to set up ""I only want this many ___ per week"". Additionally, the funny reminders are funny... because they're ridiculous. I don't think an English speaker wrote them, but I can't convince myself to disable them because they're so strange. 😂"	1

The app idea is great on itself. However, there are too many options blocked behind the pro version which one would think are basic: whitelist and exporting the progress (changing phones makes all the progress be lost). Moreover, although not essential, some free achievements would also be nice, even if they don't give any coins. I'm willing to change my rating if I see any of those changes, since like I said, the app is quite good already (free version feels like less than a free trial...)	0
Slow updates, bugs	-1

I like this app. I only used it for 5 mins and there are no adverts that ruin your experience. I hope that the developers will continue working on it so that the app will be improved. I would consider paying for the premium features too if the app is good enough.	1

Great concept, but riddled with bugs. Sign up was horribly difficult, with the servers not responding and the app failing to realize I was trying to change my username and display names.

So far the app has functioned excellently. I have not run into any issues. It's very simple and straight forward. However, I do recommend you read the user start guide as you'll find out about not so intuitive functions which make everything not only more seamless but even simpler than before. I would seriously recommend to anyone looking for a Todo app, I've been using the free version and no complaints and no ads. Definitely give it a try and you won't regret it.	1
it's fine to use to check off stuff and gain/lose habits and get rewarded for it, but the formatting is so ugly and it's so easy to cheat which kinda defeats the purpose of the app. like you can make yourself level 100 or give yourself 2,000 gold if you want to. plus there's a lot of bugs even though habitica has been alive since either 2015 or 2014 so that kinda says it all for how much the staff is on things.	0

First impression is sufficient but not excellent. There are no settings for applying priorities to tasks and I couldn't find also a setting for repeating tasks (daily or for certain periods) for specified hours (from 17:00 - 20:00).	0
"Setting things up can be a bit confusing but overall it's good. The notifications aren't working on my phone, and when setting the task to something that can be completed all day, I'd like to be able to set times for me to get notifications about it without having to do the weird ""give me a notification 12 hours before"" The whole point of me getting a to-do list app was to have not only a list, but reminders, so until the notifications work I'll have to resort to a different app."	0
Very good for scheduling, making tasks and sorting your day, considerably better than Google calendar, but there is a part of the app that you have to buy. Works fine without buying, I use it on a daily basis	1

This app is a simple an elegant solution for tracking habits, it offers widgets as well as a nice simple interface for getting habits done. I guess if i had to complain I think i had an issue where if there was a task set to be complete x days a week it would not go away on the widget ever even if you had done the task the required amount of times a week, could have been my mistake however, otherwise great!	1

This app is a very very poor replacement for Wunderlist, which is a wonderfully organized app. Wonderlist should never be taken out of the app market! In my opinion, it's the Microsoft app that should disappear on May 6, NOT Wunderlist! Wunderlist has a 4.6 approval rating; Microsoft has a 4.2 rating. That should tell you something. It took an act of God for my Microsoft account to get up and running. It was locked and I was forced to jump through several hoops. Ridiculous!	-1

Unfortunately Tic Tick is better app for me 😑.	0
"My personal experience with the app makes me say this is deforme designed more as a task management app than a habit tracking app. The two things I want to do when building a new habit are 1) easily enter the stats for the habits I'm tracking and 2) see the timeline of the habit growth in a snapshot or as a dashboard. This app focuses on ""today's tasks"", so getting to the specific habits, entering information for another day and charting progress are too cumbersome."	0

Review Update: the scheduling function I wanted has been included at some point in the past (which I did not know as I stopped looking for it long ago.) So... I am now pleased and revising my rating! Original Review: This app is good but I do not understand why they do not create a way to make a recurring (annual) event for, say, the 3rd Thursday in July. One can only create recurring events on the same DATE weekly, monthly, annually. That is not how many events are scheduled in the real world.	1

This has been really engaging in my tasks and goals and I am just at day two of using it. For the app, it would be cool if there was a notification for any chat threads users are on so if anybody had a follow-up question, I would be able to return to the inquiry and add more to the discussion if needed.	1

I just downloaded it to see the continuity of work I do. I found it personally useful. 1st : I am reminded by the large display of tracking down my habit. which I wanted to continue. 2nd : Now I can read the comments I entered after finishing the tasks. Now it is becoming habit for me to keep track on my habits that i see improvement in overall doing. i hope i still achieve lot more through this app. I heartly thank to the developers and creators of this app. signing off.	1

Day 2 of trialling this. So far I've had two location reminders fail, I can't label a location with more than one letter, the only time based reminder that's fired did so while on a phone call so I don't know what it sounds like, not that I can change the sound anyway because the instructions don't work. I had no idea what the buttons meant so the first one tapped the task got snoozed for 28 hours. How is that a typical snooze length? Adding anything more than a basic list item is not intuitive	-1

5.5.5.0: Habits widget improved but lacking. NEEDS ALSO SINGLE COLUMN LAYOUT for habits widget. THE GOOD: 1. SOME offline. 2. Habits. 3. Pomo timer. 4. Dark theme. 5. Sorting lists (only Paid). THE BAD: 1. Too expensive to use basic features. Make it $10 lifetime. 2. Social aspect sucks. Needs public leaderboard (OPEN to free users) & search find & add users. 3. Limited export feature. Use Titanium Backup. Share option ok but only one list, need full backup export all. 4. Need 100% offline mode	1

Great app, easy to use, nice design, motivating statistics and quotes. Thank you developers for this app :). Only one remark from me: if I change the number of repetitions per week of an activity, it changes the whole statistics (also for the previous period). Maybe there could be an option to apply this change only to further period (e.g. when I start an activity twice a week, it becomes a habit and I want to increase it to 3 times a week and I don't want to lose/worsen previous statistics).	1
I've been using BC1 for years and I've installed BC2 on at least 2 seperate occasions. BC2 is so not as good as BC1. The overall look makes it look like a cheap childs game. The functionality became nonsensical and it made going back to BC1 such a pleasure. I can't imagine what the developers were thinking when making such changes. After using BC1 for so long I had high hopes for its future development but alas it not to be. These days I'm looking elsewhere.	0

Extremely Disappointed. I had been a faithful user of this app and loved it. Then all of sudden everything changed. There is no cloud support. The tabs option is gone. There is no interface with established tasks list. I have tried and tried to use. I contacted support and they replied that due to streamlining the app it has a completely new appearance. I had uninstalled this app, however I felt I needed to write thos review. After I finish this, uninstalling this app. Useless to me.	-1

I've tried reinstalling so many times but to no avail. Only very few events of his would show up on my calendar and not the whole thing. I'm not sure what's going on 😭	0

This app should be made to work around certain schedules. For example; people who work the third shift (graveyard shift), have a completely different schedule than, say a person who works a 9-5/7-3/3-11, etc. I'm certain this adjustment would be greatly appreciated	0

I do not like the functionality of the app. I found it is very easy to delete a sub list. But if you create a second list I could not figure out how to delete it after going through all settings. I also did not like the fact that you can only add one item within the sub list. Other people may be okay with these nuances, but for me it's not. I only use this app for about a half an hour and then deleted it.	-1

Absolutely the best to do app out there. Great UI, great features. Use it for general stuff, shared shopping lists and household tasks, projects... everything. Well worth it for the paid version too. The only features I'd like to see are more than once a day scheduling (eg. morning, noon and night; can workaround with multiple tasks) and repeatable projects (think recipes; can workaround with templates but difficult).	1

Really intuitive but also has loads of functionality. Looks great, very responsive (even on my low-spec phone), does much more than Google equivalent, worth moving to if you want your calendar to be separate from your to-do lists (I do). That said, I'm confident there would be some fairly easy way to do almost anything with this app. Never felt better about giving five stars to an app!	1

Took more than 3 years, but they've finally managed to get BC2 to a similar perhaps even better level than the original. 3/10/2019.. update. Unfortunately, usability is severely compromised. Busy calendars are almost unreadable unless in day view. Tap to create appointment can drop you in very strange time slots (10:05 or 14:40). Clock to set times is backward step from BC1 which is BY FAR the best way to set times on a calendar. I like the auto link to contacts in bc2. 2 line favorites bar pls.	0

Now I don't trust this at all! I learned about the transfer just today so.immediatley thought I'd swop over. Everything seemed fine, I got a pop up to say everything had been successfully transferred. Then this evening I'm just adding something when I get a pop up that the transfer was incomplete! So what do I do now? Unless I cross check everything in all the lists I have how do I know what's missing/not transferred?! OMG! I seriously do not need this right now 😠😡	-1
"Since Microsoft scrapped ""Wunderlist"" for ""Microsoft To-Do"" which is a significant downgrade, I had to look for an alternative.

I used to keep my to-do list in a simple text file with a bullet point denoting each task to be done. I decided that I needed a better way to organise my ‘to-dos’ and this app met my requirements perfectly. With this app you can arrange your to-dos in order of priority, set reminders, and so forth. The interface is well-designed and can be quickly mastered. The developer has written a very useful web-based help page that will enable you to get the most out of the app.	1

My original review seems to have disappeared. I have an issue on my Galaxy Note S8 where I can't turn off the alarms without uninstalling. I received a response from support, but couldn't respond directly. Their response was simply that I should be able to swipe the notification and the sound go away. Yes, I agree, that should happen. However, that isn't what happens. There is no notification from the app for the alarm. I receive other notifications from the app. Running out of room to explain.	0

Why don't you remove the task after it's completed? We have recurring weekly tasks and when we check it off, you have to manually remove the task from the list. Am I supposed to have like 80 completed tasks like a psychopath? 😆 I like things uncluttered. I might be able to let it go if I didn't get a notification EVERY TIME my husband removes an item because he's equally neurotic? I can't change notification settings for that either. I want to be notified of task completion, not removal.	0

The actual free version doesn't allow you anything, not even to learn how to use the app properly. That role is filled by 7 days of free premium. The free, on the description, is a lie. Is a paid-only app with temporary free access to its full features that gets practically useless after the 7-day trial. If you can get past that sort of business practice to actually try it I think the app may be great, but I don't like to be lied to. Edit: I opted for TicTic after some experiments.	-1

NOTE TO SELF::: The demo version of this app is totally useless - so there is no way of knowing if this product will be able to meet my needs BEFORE paying for the premium version. I'll find another way to get my needs met. I'm sure there are other products available for free that would do the same things. Since I'm not allowed to testdrive all the bells and whistles - I am passing this app over. No thanks. UNINSTALLING.	-1

Is it true that non-premium version soon will loose any way for backup/restore or transfer to another phone? If not true: Please point to me what is the backup/restore way that stays in app in the future. Thanks a lot!. If true: That is really bad news - backup is a basic necessity, so non-premium version will become practically useless on the long term. In addition, premium costs twice as much for a single year than, let's say OsmAnd+ for eternity. And that is a much more complex app + the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits. Tasks is a really nice app (except that swichingt between sublists/lists is unreasonably slow) with some unique and essential features. But this wracks it, it will drive me away. Possibly others too. Not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that. RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S RESPONSE: That is fair enough, except for one important detail: all the people using your free app are now forced to decide - if they want to have a meaningful app - to pay or search for another app. Premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities. If you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing, people will buy it. Lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them, now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay. I payed for a number of apps (all cheaper than yours btw.), and actually my plan was to pay/donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear, because I thought the app is really useful and it deserves support. This change is different. I do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc., just that you should not remove the free local backup (or any other feature). Or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start. Best wishes! RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S SECOND RESPONSE: Actually you can clearly see from my review that I do not want everything for free. My problem is different. If we could not understand each other so far, perhaps it's not worth trying any more. So I won't comment on the rest of your answer. All the best!	0

"Very nice app with a bad drawback: today's repetition for a recurring task will not appear unless I mark yesterday's task as done! Here's how this is very bad for me: - I have many recurring daily tasks, and it's a very tedious job to mark all my recurring tasks as done, even those that were NOT done! It gets much worse if I don't use the app for a few days! Then I have to mark all recurring tasks as done for every and each previous day!!!! - The app forces me to record false information! A task that was not done on a specific day, should stay there as NOT done, and the recurring task should be generated for the following day. - You have only 3 options for a recurring task: 1) to mark it as done in order for it to appear on the following day. 2) not to mark it as done, and it will never ""recur""! 3) to delete, and it disappears, and naturally, it will never ""recur""! A recurring task should recur, regardless of marking or not marking the previous repetition as done!"	-1

'It's free, forever' but 'reminders are a premium feature.' Hmm. I'm dyspraxic, without much money to waste, and I'm looking for a to-do list app to help with this. Without reminders, this app is functionally useless to me. Disappointed that you've opted to content-carve to this extent, and I'd argue your claim of being free is misleading. Please reconsider which features to gatekeep, because locking basic functions behind a paywall makes me *less* likely to support you financially.	-1

I am a long time user and lover of Wunderlis, the predecessor of this app. And I like the new concept, I was using the old app as a to do list as well BUT there are a few things I take issue with: 1. you cannot reange the order of your tasks. 2. in every list you have to check the box: make finished tasks invisible/visible. The combination of the 2 make it impossible to stay organized. I hope they fix this stuff soon, I don't see any reason why this isn't already a feature.	0

Easy setup for the most part but ended up deleting it. Only one level of subtasks makes the to do list suboptimal. Only links to Google based calendars so my work, school and personal calendars aren't seen. [there is a disconnect between the app and the referenced article's options and instructions]. I don't mind paying for premium features as long as it is a one-time payment, the whole SAAS model is annoying.	-1

This is not a multi-protocol task manager as the description false implies. This is a front end to their service. I couldn't get past the first screen because it requires me to set up an account to sync. I use a private server capable of syncing things like tasks, Exchange. Most public clouds (Google, iCloud, Office365, email providers) have this capability, therefore why should I need to send my data elsewhere if it's already on a server. The fact that data is not something you can touch doesn't make it less valuable. Be mindful of it, it *is* our most valuable asset today, it may not be tangible but it sure can be quantified endlessly. Requiring signing up for any app is a huge red flag.	-1

I have recently upgrade the app to the Pro version, and I've got to say that while I enjoy the concept of Forest through keeping the tree alive, since the upgrade the app keeps crashing😭!!! When I go to the store to unlock a new tree it come up with an 'error' message and when I want to plant a new tree once the timer is up, I need to restart the app. I didn't experience any problems as such before hand, and while this app is up-to-date I'm not sure why I'm experiencing this problem (???)	0

I really love this app. I find myself wanting to make tasks for myself about it. It has an incredibly clean UI and feels great to use. The only issue I have with it is the pricing model for the pro version. For 5 or 6- admittedly useful- features, there's a monthly subscription. Which personally I find to be ludicrous. I'd willingly pay a one time charge, but a monthly payment is just silly for this app.	1

This is a very cool app, and thus have the ratings. How ever it will be nice if you can add the functionality of sharing task or even with other users. This will make it the all in one Project/Task manager. Review Update : Previously, I was able to pick custom tags when setting a new event, but now I can't and I have to pick a color and look for the same icon each time I want to create a new event. This is counter productive as the main aim of the app is to help optimize time. Please fix this	0

I personally would like to add to this app, if I had a chance is change how the entires were set up. You had to make up the name. But it would make it better if it had a date and name. To me it feels like something you can do on a piece of paper. Add more cool features that you can't find anywhere else.	0

Incredibly useful service and thanks so much for creating it. The app tends to be buggy, but nothing that couldn't easily be worked around until the last update. Since the last update drag and drop sorting of To Do (and I suspect Dailies as well) subtasks/checklists no longer works which is really frustrating. At least the website works great as always. It's just frustrating to have to run down to the computer to fix my lists.	0

"I bought the Pro version a few weeks ago...great concept. A few things I would like to change but can't find it in the instructions or in other reviews. Is there a way to remove my alarm clock icon on the clock face--it's irrelevant, didn't ask me to place it there, and takes up precious space? Also and most importantly, I would like the hour hand to reflect the ""real time"" so I can visualize instantly how much time is left until the next scheduled task is due. For myself, having to press the arrows to move the hour hand and watch a countdown timer to the next task is of no value. If the hour hand issue can be addressed to reflect ""real time"" I'll give it a 5, otherwise the App wont work for me and it stays at a 3. I'm surprised no-one else has mentioned this and I'm wondering if my install developed a slight bug. Update...Jan 20, 2020... I received prompt response from developer...fixed issues. My phone was an older Note3 running Android 5.0 so it was a bit different...works fine now...changed to 5 stars."	1

Has the potential to be an excellent all in one calendar and to-do list, however I cancelled my subscription two weeks in as: 1. Subtasks automatically repeat when repeating main task is completed, regardless of time and due date settings. This should be optional. 2. Subtask reminders should be optional 3. Calendar functions are very limited, e.g. ability to set up an event rather than a task would be a valuable addition	0

Horribly simplistic. I found AFTER I had paid for premium that there is NO way to change the due date on an existing task. Renders the program useless!!

After the last update I had to clear the cache & data, clear the cache partition, then lose all my events to stop the double notifications/reminders.

"I used Todoist Premium for about 6 years but I must say that it has gone down over the years. There are so many features missing compared to other similar apps which are either free or charge much less for their premium version. The new ""major update"" feels like a complete let down with absolutely no new features other than now being able to see subtasks in the parent task dialog box. Still no Kanban view, no native calendar view, limited to no sorting options, just to name a few. I'm sorry, but dabbing a bit of color on icons or adding a color name next to a color do not qualify as new features. I left Todoist for TickTick a couple of months ago and have not looked back."	-1

Quite useful little widget. I only wish I had control over which calendar it used. it seems to only pick up the Google/Samsung and I would like to use the widget for my repetitive schedule AND a second widget for my daily planner. There is the ability to select which calendar within the Google app I want to use, but that just makes the calendar side messy. Two separate app calendar selection would solve this for me, unless anyone has a better idea how I can get around this? Still, thank you dev	1
My own structuring of little tasks and routines improves with this app. I really like the app, but I would also like it on my laptop. It would be great if you developed an option to install and use it on both devices, as I don't always have my phone on me while working. Or did I miss something? It doesn't allow me to install the app on my laptop, it only shows that it is already installed on my phone. Looking forward to your response. Thanks in advance!	1

For anyone who wants to manually order your list, just long press the task and drag/drop it. It's really easy. My 3 out of 5 is because the widget seems broken. I have a large 3 x 3 widget to see my Planned tasks. The list randomly disappears in the widget. Open the app and it's still there. Go to the widget it's still missing. Randomly it comes back. If this gets fixed, it'll be 5 of 5.	0

Never seen a worse app than this one. Seriously? I am just wondering how it got 4.6 rating on average. You plant 5 grass blades in the name of trees. One can't connect to friends and has to wait for hours like, seriously? Wish I could lessen this one star to a 0.01. Oh really? Then why you rob people telling them about features in pro version if it is only supposed to stop us from using phone.	-1

Nice configuration settings. Able to set most goals. One setting that I couldn't get to work for me was trying to get a goal for every other day. It seemed to that the goal needed to be completed every second day and comoleting it on off days didn't work. The UI is slightly un-intuitive as well. I don't think swiping up on a goal calendar should swap to another goal. It makes it hard to scroll down to the community form at the bottom if the app.	1

"I wanted to use this app. The concept is really good. But I won't use it simply because it barely functions. For starters it's online only... but as if that wasn't enough the sync on Android is just all over the place - the app would sometimes ask ""have you done these things today?"" for tasks that were scheduled the day before or at 1 AM for tasks on that day... Speaking of tasks, I couldn't set up multiple repeating tasks for certain days of the week (per task, wanted to fill the whole week with various tasks and repeat them) for some reason, they would all sync to same weekdays. I enabled reminders but never had a reminder come up once and as far as I researched online this is a common problem on Android and hasn't been resolved for some time. So it seems I have to create a habit of opening this habit tracker app..."	-1

hey Lonnie! I`ll be there next weekend I can`t wait.	1
This was a great app, a year or more, ago. The simplicity of adding and checking off tasks, without clutter of a bunch of fancy features, was it's strength. Basically, it was as simple as making a list on a piece of paper, with the added bonus of having reminders. Now, however, it requires more steps to add to-dos, and is becoming more of a complicated app, loosing the original appeal. As of some time ago, notifications also stopped working, which mean I will leave, after some 5+ years of use.	0

I've been looking for a habit like tracker via google search, not really knowing the term or if an app really existed. Once I found what I was looking for, Habitica showed up. I installed it to my phone, looked up a YouTube video of it, and began using it. Now I'm hooked and 12 days in getting my life straightened up. Cleaning house, doing daily chores, and doing things I usually hate doing. Habitica just makes it fun to do with it being an RPG. I love it and cannot recommend it enough.	1
aww you poor thing hope all goes well!	-1
TickTick looks like a powerful and flexible productivity app but I find the help and support information across platforms somewhat overwhelming and confusing. I think that (for the easily confused) it would benefit from a good tidy-up, beginning with a clear conceptual overview of the design philosophy and architecture of the product and the methodology of its use, including flow diagrams and examples, before any specific platform advice.	1

A good app. If you know exactly what you want, you'll need this app to get started. But a lot of us don't know what we want to do. We don't have a lifestyle coach to tell us how to improve our habits, or how to be productive. We seek it out in the charming articles on the internet. So maybe populate the internet with this app's usability, behind a healthy/productive living theme. Idk, just saying.	1

Nice app, great features, good design, however the pricepoint on the monthly fee is ridiculously high and is a must for core features that any to-do app must do, things like 'reminders' and 'labels'...

Be aware: if you purchase the paid version and then try to cancel within the 14 days trial. You won't be able to. They only reply once a day if you contact them and every time you contact them you have to explain that you want to cancel the service making the days passed by and after a while they just stop replying back. Using these shady tactics to make the 14 days goes by so you can't cancel after that. This company is a joke!	-1

Good concept. But I don't use the app anymore. as someone who is now not really a gamer, the point game-like concept seems to doesn't work for me anymore and maybe it's also due to the fact that I only compete with my self. if I were to compete with a friend or whoever that is, maybe I can keep my self accountable. But that's it to it. If you are a gamer, this app might gonna help you.	1

Yes they’re still on Google and show on that app. I don't like that app but I might be stuck with it. I'm sorry this didn't last but I am glad the problem developed before I bought it.	-1
Great app all in all	1
Very innovative concept. It does what it claims to do reasonably well-help you focus. Implementation could be better though. Few very essential features are behind paywall despite the app having ads.	1

I love this app so much! They make it really fun for free players too, so you don't feel left out if you don't spend money. I have decided to get a subscription though since it's such a great app. It has my whole family super motivated, my kids are actually loving doing chores! And I also love all the social aspects to it as well. It would be cool of you could assign names for your pets, and the app doesn't function quite the same as the website version, but overall I have no complaints. :)	1

I am running this app on a Droid Turbo with stock Lollipop installed. The app has a very nice layout but unfortunately I find it to be very buggy. It is impossible to create an event that includes Monday and the app can't import recurring events from Google calendar. I have reported these to the developers and hope the app is cleaned up soon.	0

I love this app. I tried many to do list apps but this is the one that meets my satisfaction, I guess? The basic features are good, just right. But I'll give it 4 stars since I'm still finding something I myself can't say and it's not here. Maybe it's in the premium version but I'm broke as hell and I can't afford to pay for it because I have other expenses. I do hope that some other features would someday be free, it'll be really helpful.	1

I really like the application so far. Great interface and feature set. I'd really like to see and would even do an inapp purchase for would be a much larger icon set. I think being able to group characteristics and skills would be awesome too. Even better if the group can collapse. It would also be cool to see a health bar that represents the amount of time you have in a day to be productive. Have it decrement as time passes and maybe make it adjustable for how much time you have in a day i think another tasklist app does that. Overall a great application, I hope you continue working on this application. Edit: The app is still decent, but taking away the option to just remove ads for a one time price in favor of subscription only has made me decide to stop using this application and change my previous 5 star rating to a 2 star rating.	-1

"""Hey, want most of the features of our app?

Consider a 1-time unlock for all non-server featues and we can talk."	-1

Really don't like that they changed the empty time slots back to the way they were (whenever you delete an activity the activity gets replaced with an empty block separate from the empty blocks before or after it), I find it to be extremely unnecessary. But the new feature of increasing or decreasing an activity in 1, 5 or 15 minute chunks is great, and the programmer feature works well as always, particularly good for planning out studies and work.	0

Nothing better. Not sure how many years I have used this, 5+ years @least, I have tried everything out there, but nothing works as well. First, it's easy. Second, it's minimal, I don't spend more time setting up, organizing, etc. I spend my time doing what I need, not taking time in the app Third, it's every where I need to access it. Is just easy and fast and I particularly love the reminder feature. I used it free for awhile, but have happily had premium for years.	1

"The app is easy to use, but lacks the ability to list a task into multiple groups/categorize, to move an existing task into a group/category, and to group by categories in daily to-do lists. The category issue is a big deficit. It's hard to plan without it. (The flexibility with categories is what makes Outlook so outstanding -- such a shame not to find it it's ""sister app."")"	0

Taking off a star because I'm not sure where else to give feedback about the update. I'm not a fan of having to click the drop-down box in the corner in order to select multiple tasks at once. Especially because the task selection mode expires each time I make a single change to the selected tasks, requiring me to then go into the drop-down menu again to and then re-select all of the tasks I just selected. I really liked before how I could just select multiple tasks and make multiple changes to them at once in a few clicks. I know this change was made to allow easy re-ordering of tasks, although I don't find this particularly helpful because I don't typically re-order my tasks. I would prefer that this is changed back or some kind of compromise is made so that it isn't so cumbersome to edit multiple tasks at once.	1

"An awesome app. Best in field.

I would expect much more from an app that cost $30+ each and every year!! Very poor, and a pity because its fundamentally a great app."	-1

Please also add the option to import few activities from any day instead of the whole day onto timeLine of a routine. Further please add the feature of allowing a to start a routine custom routine Using time interval instead of defining exact time, because on some bad days due to unavoidable circumstances we are out of schedule and adding a fresh custom timetable for the day hurts a lot modifying Timings for every activity. For rest of its features it worth 5*****.	0

New update was step backwards. My recommemdations: 1) Have daily/weekly/monthly calendar views that show reminders and events in visual boxes (instead of just a list). 2) allow rearranging of the order of subtasks and add subtask reminder capability. Also should be able to check off individual subtasks. 3) allow a task to be turned into a calendar event instead of just a reminder 4) show that an event has subtasks from main view	0

Annoying backup system. I've had installed this app and logged in with Google account once. I also tried some of the app's features, but I uninstalled again because of reasons. After some times, I decided to install it again. So I made my tasks and the others without logging in first (because I forgot). Then, when I logged in with my Google account after that, it replace my current data with the older one without warning. Now all my newly created, more complete data is all gone.	-1

Updated review based on developer reply: Sadly not for me. For example you can't 1) turn off vibration when reordering tasks, 2) quickly select multiple tasks to assign labels, 3) view a list sorted by label/tag, 4) add priority to tasks, only labels which you cannot use for sorting the list.	1

The free app works well but pops up with annoying notifications every now and then to remind you to set more reminders... Kind of pointless. I'm also not a fan of the subscription model for premium. The layout and app itself is good though so it's a shame about those negatives. I would have considered buying if there was a one-time payment model.	0

I believe that this is by far the best app with helping ppl keep track of a lot of daily task and reminders. It's easy to function understand & it syncs with my Google calendar which is an A+ in my book.	1
EDIT, Paid out GOOD money last year to buy Premium BUT you're STILL begging me to RATE YOU. Well my original 5 stars becomes today's 3 stars. Leave me alone, I rated 5 within minutes of buying !! ~ Old Review ~ I've purchased the PREMIUM version, thank you, the best in the play store. EDIT ~ I would appreciate it if next time you have a one day sale you make it abundantly clear in the actual app otherwise I'll never know. Thank you.	0

When it works it's great but after using it for a while and paying for the ability to export and sync data, all my data is gone. Every attempt to contact them goes unanswered and the last update was over a year ago. They're willing to take your money but not to update or support the software. Use this at your own risk.	-1
This is the best productivity app I have ever used and I'll keep using it. It is so simple and intuitive, with useful reminders that keep you on track. The only option that is missing in my opinion is to set alarms (not only reminders) for tasks that can go on few hours before, other than that it's 5 stars all day long! Thanks guys.	1

I learned about the Wunderlist buyout. So I transferred over to MS To Do List. I love it & will surely miss my Wunderlist. MS To Do List is almost identical. I wasn't too afraid of the change. MS works great, but my biggest complaint is when you add something new to a list, it adds it to the bottom instead of the top. I didn't think it added it so I added it again & again. Then saw 3 same things on the bottom. I can sort based on date added, but it mixes up. Plz hurry the add to top option. Thx	1

I purchased the premium version so I can use the home screen widgets. It motivates me to stick to my habbits once I see them all the time when I use my phone. I've been using it for 2-3 weeks now and I woke up early, went to the gym, read at least 20 pages and flossed in the evening EVERYDAY. Obviously, is not all thanks to the app, but it does help to track my progress and keep me accountable if I miss anything. Just start with easy to achieve habbits to make it work long term and build on that.	1

Two things could be improved. 1. There should be a option if I want to view the tasks organized into sub-projects in a project view. (Concerning the last update) 2. The sub-tasks could be better organized. Maybe nested inside the options, just like in Microsoft's task app.	1

_lights aw what`s wrong?	-1
Unrecoverably crashed, reinstalled. Then the data partially gone. Pretty disappointed. No response from the devs. In hindsight this is an app that haven't released for more than a year, so could have been expected. Data is not critical of course (bunch of date markers), but it feels like all those habits disappeared with the data :/	-1

This app is as good as Trello and almost works the same with some minor differences. I love it. It would be great if it combined the features of Trello Boards as well as Evernote. Still givin deserves 5 stars on its own merits. It can get overwhelming the more items that are put into it, but that's my own problem of having so much to do more than the app. This is the best automated To Do list I have found. I use it in combination with my handwritten lists.	1

Okay I think it's kinda working now but the only one suggestion.

I love it! One thing I had a problem with earlier was that if I didn't have internet connection, it wasn't possible to log my dailies in. Now I have unlimited data, so this isn't a problem for me anymore, but might be worth solving this for other players. Everything else is just wonderful and a big help to life organization for scattered-mind people like myself 😅	1

After Microsoft announced the end of Wunderlist, I started using this app because of its similar UI and organizational capabilities. Been using it ever since with my girlfriend. Works for everything I need it to work for.	1
Great app for tracking whatever it is that you want to develop as a regular habit. Clean interface and very easy to set up new habits like exercising on set days, not smoking or taking medicine. The 'streaks' length & percentage success are good motivators and give you a nice visual reference for how well you're doing.	1

Great incentive/nudge to be present during the activity/practice of your choice. A gentle way to reinforce mindful habits. If I know my tree is going to die because of lack of time or focus, I either clear more time if possible, schedule the task for a more appropriate time-slot or take a few deep breaths to center to why I chose to do this or is this something I really want to do in the first place. It's like a little promise to yourself before diving in.	1
i hated that you cannot edit certain things. For example when you go to make a schedule there's no option to delete blank slots, no obvious anyway.	-1

I'm using this app for all my recurring reminders that I need to remember that I don't actually want on my To Do list (like fill up water bottle, remind kids to pack their lunches, etc). I've tried several apps; the reason I've settled on this one for those reminders is b/c it will give me a reminder notification EVERY time whether or not I completed it last time. I LOVE that you can select specific days of the week (not just weekly or daily). My biggest concern is it not having cloud backup.	1
I have been using Habitica for quite some time now and i must say, it has been the most useful in helping me establish a structure to my day. HOWEVER, the To-Dos are very limited in its functions. It's hard to implement a full task management (such as GTD methodology). It pretty much only supports next action steps, not any layers such as Projects or Waiting For. Also, syncing across devices can sometimes be problematic I hope they will improve the To-Dos and make syncing smoother.	1

I had Wunderlist, but it changed to Microsoft To Do. To Do is more clunky than Wunderlist. It does not currently group starred items by category. It does not have a variety of theme back grounds, and the sharing of lists with others had to be done list-by-list and was unnecessaryily time consuming. I am hoping to see significant improvements in thia app.	-1

This app is terrible compared to wunderlist especially if you like the functionality to share a list with another. We cannot seem to get the shareable feature to work. Additionally, even though I'm logged in with the same account on my laptop and phone., it doesn't sync lists. New items are added to the bottom of a list instead of the top. Microsoft has a lot of work to do to get this where it needs to be.	-1

"App broken, don't bother. Like many many other reviewers, this app is totally broken and defunct on Android devices and specifically Galaxy S10 / Note 10 devices.

I have instead now downloaded an app by another developer which actually works. I will not be back."	-1

I really like the concept of this app, the style, the features, and it has done its part in motivating my studies and organizing my life. However, the app needs some serious redesigning. The layout is difficult to navigate and the chat function is almost useless. The way challenges are organized could also use improvement. All in all, I like using it (make an account a month ago), but the functionality needs to be improved	1

If the other option is the recommended one (which I hate that it adds an alarm icon in the status bar. other apps work without doing this), it doesn't mean the other one IS NOT WORKING. Bad.

"This app is great as far as the calendar and task functions. However, it is nearly unbearable to use since it doesn't respect the phone setting to not notify during a call. When it notifies during a phone call using the regular carrier app (not Skype, Hangouts or other app), it buzzes and sends a loud notification that is painful and very disruptive. I sent in a support request 3.5 years ago and they said it shouldn't do that and they were going to ""look into it."" But they haven't fixed it in any updates and it's been the same on all of the different phones I've had since then, not just an isolated issue on one phone."	0
lol. thanks babe!	1
I am so glad it`s Friday. I just got off work and I`m so tired.	0

I really like this app. The concept of blocking your times is great and I find it helps me structure my time really well. It's also a load off of my mind knowing that I don't need to think about when to eat or what time to check my email because I am at ease knowing it's all planned for and I will be informed accordingly. My only disappointment, with the service and not the app, is that I am unable to structure my timeline online on a PC. I think there are limitations of the mobile device that makes the scheduling somewhat confusing. I think it will be perfect to incorporate a way to set up your schedule on a nice large screen and use your phone for viewing and notifications.	1

I'm shocked there isn't a free trial period for this app. All the things that I'm looking for are premium features and aren't unlocked without a subscription. As a rule I do not subscribe to anything unless I am confident it will add value. A trial would help me make that assessment.	0
Missing one key feature: custom sorting of lists. Otherwise quite good. Search capability is excellent.	1
ouch. I hate it when that happens.	-1
DO NOT PURCHASE! The app works as it's supposed to, with exception for the added purchase features. I bought the app so it could sync up with multiple devices, that feature does not work despite following the FAQ as to why it might not work. I have tried their support ticket system which had an automated response, but they have yet to respond despite me trying multiple times to reach them and ask for assistance or a refund.	-1
Helped me stay focused! Usually when I study I always have my phone around and i keep getting distracted by my phone(twitter, yt etc.) i have an upcoming exam this week and I decided to stay focus so I downloaded this app! Its great and it really works! The first time i tried to give up i was so sad to kill a tree so i try to focus! I really recommend this app especially for my fellow students! (also excuse my grammar because english is not my first language :)) )	1

No way to integrate with google assistant on a pixel. It's great app by itself, but unless developers figure out a way to make this happen, this gets one star. At the moment todoist has a work around, but ultimately, im just looking for something that allows me to get thoughts into a task list without needing to search for my phone and get into the app. Sorry devs.	-1

The app is okay. It would be nice if I could sort tasks by due date, change the order of to-dos manually without bugs, and have the option of dark mode. Streaks for dailies should be more visual so as to increase motivation. Undo button is a must. Sometimes the touches don't register, quite a few small bugs.	0
hope the studyin went well	1
We can compare horror stories mate LOL	0
It is a cool app, but the calendar feature required to be bought. That should be informed to the users before installation. In addition, it would be a good idea if skills can increase over time, and skills can decrease characteristics.	1

This app works nice if you want to track daily or weekly tasks, but it was impossible for me to schedule tasks that should happen at a certain interval. For example, every two weeks, or every 5th of the month. There is the option to schedule a task a certain amount of times per month, but not to set specific intervals or dates for such occurrences. This was unfortunately a dealbreaker.	0

What appealed to me the most about this app was the promise that we get to see the clock on your home screen. However the settings doesn't offer that option... Now it's just another app callendar you have to tap to see what's coming up... I liked the idea I could just turn on my phone and bang! the clock would just simply show me my schedule... Idk if it's a bug or just a false promise, either way it's disappointing.	-1

I downloaded this app because the other app I was using wouldn't always notify me. Also, they recently decided to change from an analog clock face to having to scroll (similar to a digital clock) to set the due time. I tested this app before I started copying all my tasks, but I came across a problem. When creating a repeat, there is no way to set it to do a certain day of the month (ie: the 3rd Saturday of the month, or the Last Sunday of the month). This is a big issue for me because I have certain things I want to do, but it's not always on the same date of the month. Hopefully, this can be added/changed soon.	0

And once again, here we have another app that gets worse with every update. Over complicating things. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

Currently considering going back to the previous app I used to use.	-1

The app is great for the schedule but the tasks needs work . I should be able to schedule something to repeat every day but it doesn't allow for that option. And it doesn't always register the repeats. Had to pay for the yearly subscription to find out it doesnt even work. Stick with the free version. Least youre not wasting your money.

This app is exactly what I was searching for. Tried many productivity apps, but this the ideal app for that purpose. It lets you plan your whole day as a schedule and lets you repeat the schedule as a custom routine. Lots of other tools and customizations. Best for procrastinators (like me) and for students who are preparing for exams.	1
Habitnow is the first todo list with a key feature I've been looking for: to-do items that are automatically created at certain times. As such it is the best such app I've ever used. The only problem is that the author made no provision for hiding completed items. They just hang around cluttering the list--the best it does is move them to the bottom. I find it very odd that anyone would want to stare at completed to-do items. Certainly that shouldn't be the default, but there it is.	1

Using this app is a great way to organize assignments/ daily tasks/ appointments/ to-do lists. You can keep track of what is due and what has been completed. I use it to keep track of assignments for all of my classes and it's so easily accessible and user-friendly. This app has helped me break my terrible habit of procrastinating. I actually look forward to doing my homework just so that I can check off all the tasks on my list 😋	1

I have been using this app for many years. Definitely one of the best calendar apps for Android. Unfortunately, too big desire for monetization of the app won. Full screen ads which you cannot close are now popping up after adding events and more. Such a big disappointment! You can of course purchase the app but for me it doesn't add any more value as I don't use pro functions. I guess it's time to switch to Google's native app.	-1

I accepted a 14 day free trial but changed my mind just straight away. How do I cancel? I go into my subscriptions in Google play but I do not find this app among my subscriotions. I suppose it will turn up there only when the 14days free trial is over. Pleas confirm how to cancel. Thanks//	0
It's pretty neat, helps get things done, especially if there's people in your every day life to play and compete with. Adding a to- done list that kept log of the to- dos you check off would be cool. And adding some sort of actual gameplay with the avatars and the items you gather might be neat too	0

I was mortified when I heard Wunderlist was going to be withdrawn. I downloaded this as suggested and I am pleased with it. It is much the same with a few little extras. Easy to use and well organised without a lot of extra clutter that other apps give you. I have decided to use this app immediately instead of waiting until Wunderlist ends.	1

This will meet many people's needs. Best multi-platform apps. Best location reminders. Easy to use. I would like start dates and others have requested them for years but Todoist refuses to add them. Down a star for that. The offer a work-around but it's not convenient.	1

Notifications fixed. App keeps getting better. I'd like to suggest being able to use habit generation as an unlock condition for achievements. Edit: Nice :D Another thing I would suggest is add the date when an achievement was unlocked (example: unlocked 01/04/2019) so we can also order them by this date when looking the unlocked tab. Thanks for this app!	1

Very expensive for a simple app, and quite useless without buying the premium. Only tracks 5 habits? Lame.

Sounds like even if I bought premium it would be worthless for transferring data to a new phone as the app claims, I won't even risk it.	-1

Interface similar to Wunderlist, functionally not the same unfortunately. As an example, Wunderlist allows manual sorting after sorting by one of the sort options (alphabetical, etc), which can fine tune things beautifully. Microsoft To Do does not allow manual sorting unless you deactivate the selected sort (like deactivating alphabetical sort as an example). This then reverts everything back to the same unsorted mess prior to the selected sort option. Very frustrating.	-1

Basic version works as described; just not what I need. The habits I want to improve require reminders at different times of day. And I'm personally not finding it an effective incentive, especially 'starting over' if missing one time. That's kind of a carrot AND stick approach. I'll stick to a simple checklist of what, & calendar/alarm clock to remind me when. Making this app's functions kind of ...basic and redundant? And since all apps use space... well, uninstalled. But the app works fine.	1

I have used this app for months on a daily basis, and was finding it really useful. However the app recently forced me to do an update and all my tasks were deleted as a result, as were the specific categories I set up. I tried deleting the app fully and redownloading it to see if that helped but my tasks still didn't reappear, even though my diary is syncing OK. I have lost over 80 tasks and can't remember all the info included in each task. It has shaken my faith in using the app again, particularly as I haven't received a response to the message I sent the team via the support link several days ago now.	-1

My only complaint was that I purchased the app thinking that I could always use the in app currency to plant real world trees. It only allows you to plant 5 but otherwise it's a useful app.	1

A minimalistic task management and scheduling app with an beautiful interface and great widgets as well and packs a punch in terms of free features. Any.do does not allow sublists and allows only one level of subtasks to ensure simplicity, but compromising power. I have also found it quite cumbersome to add a task, put it into the right list and add a label to it. This is a long drawn out process which takes so much time and completely ruins the rest of the simplicity the app has.	0

Would be perfect if there was a calendar view. Update: it is the perfect app to manage my To-do lists for every aspect of my life. The ability to have sub-lists based on priorities and the calendar view make this app the best!	1

It's useful. I wasn't sure how good it'd be at keeping me focused, but it really does help--and it shows me how much I use my phone. Also, the gardens are quite pretty. I would like more realistic varieties of plants and for it to not be so expensive to plant real trees, though. Seems fitting to be able to plant trees in real life with every tree you plant. I'd be much more willing to recommend this app to people if I could plant a real tree with every full tree I plant in the app.	-1

Serviceable but not awesome by any means. I've spent enough time trying to set up tasks in here that I feel like I can't bail even though I don't love it. It's really tricky to figure out how to make tasks show up like I want and have only been able to really get things set up right by using the website in addition to the app. Nothing is intuitive or easy to figure out in this app.	-1

Hi! So I was supposed to be rating this perfect but I want this app to be improved because I love it so much! It's so small yet compact. I love it. My problem is it doesn't have a backup option. Like a sync thing that I can do it on my Google account. I hope you guys have that option the same with other note apps. Thanks a lot!	1

"Please FIX the WIDGET annoying error; whenever I press the ""+"" button to add something to any particular group I set, it always move - only - to the ""Task"".

Decent app but repeatedly asking me to pay a monthly subscription for a fancy to-do list is completely unacceptable. Take no for an answer.	-1
Its not easily understood and it does not notify if you are setting a task that the due date or due time is past. I might want to set 16:00hrm task tomorrow at 18:00hrm today, it will still set the task and will think I have set a task. Meanwhile the date is today	0

_apuya hey hey andrew!!! haha! ;P well happy mother`s day to your mum.	1
haha that`s way cool! Good morning	1
This would be great if it didn't require me to mark negatives. in other words, it requires me to mark everyday I did NOT do something, such as smoke a cigarette or drink alcohol. This is overly cumbersome over time and is going to cause me to stop using the app because I don't want to have to check everything that DIDN'T happen. This could be much better if it assumes I didn't drink or smoke if I didn't make any mark for that day. Or at least give me the option to do it this way.	-1

This WAS a great list app. Then something happened and I stopped getting notifications. I checked the app and it said I needed to allow permissions due to Android 6.0. I've been on Android 7.0+ since I started using the app, but regardless, I checked and permissions were set and allowed the app to provide notifications. Still didnt work. I've tried resetting the phone, resetting permissions... nothing works. Now I'll try uninstalling it and using something else.	-1

I've spent lot of time creating great multilevel reccuring subtasks just to find out that I actually see them unorganized in most needful page - today! And in Projects they are organized, but all together, regardless deadline. This is sooooo inconvenient, that makes having subtasks functionality just useless. Why can't you show subtasks under their parents everywhere? REPLY: Sorry, but it's inconsistent logic, as currently you show subtasks, that are NOT due today under task, that is due today.	-1
Loved this app for years. The new full screen ads with no skip option is ridiculous and will likely drive me away. I understand the need for ads but this is too far and I have no need for any of the pro features so I will not pay for it when I can use a different app for free that doesn't block my productivity. I used to recommend this app to anyone who asked but now I won't.	-1

Habitica is the best productivity app I've used thus far. It lasted me for months. The quests are the most motivating feature, and I was able to take down a couple bosses solo. However, motivation dried up weeks into my first fetch quest because despite being extremely productive, I had no chance of finding even one shard. Unless you're comfortable teaming up with a bunch of strangers to take on quests, there becomes a point when being solo makes the quest motivation feature impossible.	1

I would really like to see the inbox feature in Wunderlist brought over. There is currently no efficient way to quickly add tasks so you can sort/organize them later. On the main page, there is only an add list button, and I don't want to add everything to My Day. This gets cluttered and messy. It would also be nice if tasks that you have assigned for a certain day are automatically added to My Day, instead of having to go through and look for tasks that are due and add them to My Day manually.	0

first of all, I am thrilled with the app. If I know how it works. Is there a list of ready-made tasks? On the start screen there are some suggested ones. When I press the plus button, I actually expect a list with all possible tasks. But instead of that I only have the possibility to create a new task. At first I thought that I had to subscribe. I have subscribed now but unfortunately it is still not possible. Now I have deleted all tasks from the start screen. If I click on the plus, there is still no list. It comes again: new task	1

It's a great app, used it for over a year happily. Even paid for it. Recently had to switch phones and when I reinstalled on my new phone the sync function doesn't work. Without sync i've lost all my data. Tried emailing the developers for support but they don't reply.	-1
Sephora is having a 75% off sale. And I`m so broke Life isn`t fair.	-1
It would be a very helpful app if it actually worked the way you'd expect... if I say I want a task to be weekly, but make it so I can complete that task any day, what I'm trying to do, is make the task flexible, so I can do the weekly task whatever day of the week I feel like, instead however, making it available everyday turns it into a daily task, which I will be punished for by not completing daily, my only real solution at the moment is filling up my to-do list which is really frustrating.	-1

I've tried many productivity hacks, tools, and methods. This app is something that has stayed consistent throughout. It has everything you need in one place, no ads, and the pro features are for things that are extra, like for a company or team. My favorite part is how much you can customize every to-do list, folder and sub-folder to go with your personal style of working. Definitely worth downloading.	1

Mostly good but simply things like creating subtasks are incredibly fiddly, why can you do it from only projects? Why can you only do it by long pressing and dragging slightly to the right (to much marks is completed) allow a simple option on the menu. Deleting tasks is several options in etc. Doing almost anything other than straight adding tasks is cumbersome as hell and just frustrating. Needs some real UX love.	-1
Weak and underdeveloped platform. Don't expect support to treat you like a person - this is a company that just wants your money and then to forget about you.	-1
This app is the best, I started leaving my games, YouTube, social media, and just organizing my life through this, it started organising everything in my life, from the grocery lists, to my studying lists, to my cleaning lists, to the calender, and all of these and I still didnt participate in the premium of this app, it is amazing even without it, though I think it would be better with it... THIS APPLICATION IS THR BEST LIFE ORGANISER!!! DOWNLOAD IT NOW FOR FREE!!! FOR BETTER LIFE!!! ;)	1

Sync DOES NOT work! I've tried multiple times to get it to work and my internet connection is just fine. Had to switch phones when my old phone died and can't get my old data back on the app because sync doesn't work. Also no way to import data. Great app if the feature worked or could import data, but rendered useless because of this. So if I switch phones or have to reset to factory standards, I lose everything. Paid quite a bit for this app just for this feature alone, but it DOES NOT work.	-1

I don't often buy apps above the basic level, but Business Calendar (and now Business Calendar 2) has helped me keep track of appointments so well for so long that I did. I've now had premium for almost a year & still thoroughly enjoy the added functionality & appreciate that the app is fully functional (albeit with some added time required in some cases) at the free level. Thanks for such a great app, & please make this app for iPhone too so my partner & I can use the same calendar app!	1

I've had this for about 6 months now and tbh its helped me out. you're allowed 5 free habits. any more than that you have to pay but i think 5 is a great start because you dont want to bombard yourself with too many changes. its simple, easy to use...it takes awhile to form habits so be patient and honest with your entries. it'll help you see where you're failing and succeeding by %. i noticed i did habits because i didnt want to fail. now i notice i perform habits because i want to excel.	1

Can't change font sizes (old guy) and even with premium trial, can not change recurring task to monthly day of month from monthly day of week. Or, I should say you can make the change, but next time viewing task it shows - repeat every third Monday of the month - rather than - every month on the 20th. Also, I don't see a way to force sync account, . . . if that matters.	-1

This is one of the few circular calendar widgets available, but it has a little ways to go before I'd want to keep it. Possible Improvements: -Sync to Outlook -Easy color coding options for each scheduled event: would be nice to see Red for gym, Orange for meal times, green for Bill paying, blue for sleep, etc. -Would prefer a widget that I can tap on without it opening the app. Small dot next to the widget is fine to open apps. -Would also prefer a 3D widget that appeared to be hanging, so when I tapped it, it reacted to the tap. -Double sided widget, AM on one side, PM on the other. -Drag to reschedule events -Hold to add events -Hold to edit events.	0

The MOST IMPORTANT features needed: 1) a MULTIPLE sort features like alphabetical, then by priority, date, etc (we are talking about very organized people using these lists) 2) a data import and export feature to backup & import lists (csv files so the 500k+ people who used ListMaster can transition to your app) while keeping our info safe (if our phone dies or is lost or stolen) 3) a feature to attach files or pictures Make ALL of these additional features for $1 month to get monthly income	0
● 2019-10-15 EDIT: Just wanted to update my previous reviews to say that the problem I initially encountered seems to have gone away. I don't know exactly when, or how (maybe thanks to an automatic update of the app itself or Android), but TimeTune notifications now happen reliably and on time, just as you would expect, so I'm now upgrading my initial 4 stars to 5 stars—big thanks to the devs! ● 2018-11-05 EDIT: Already in touch with support and testing. After restarting my device it appears to be working, but I will need to test for a few days before I can confirm ● INITIAL REVIEW: App itself is great, but Android keeps closing it after a few minutes of inactivity. As a result, notifications don't happen. I've followed the troubleshooting steps which I was already familiar with and have worked for other apps. just not for TimeTune. I wish I could fix this, it's such a great app!	1

The app itself is a great concept and it works wonderfully. But the fact that you have to pay actual money to help plant real trees is what made me uninstall it altogether.

Overall the app is a great concept if you just want to plant fake trees yo help you focus.	0

I used to use this app to set intervals of when I would check in to games I was playing, but since they removed the timer feature for some reason, the scheduling stuff doesn't suit my purposes. Still, the app should be able to help you maintain a schedule just fine, but most phones have that feature built in.	0
to be honest, i love this app, really useful and tackles productivity in a fun way, but since im traveling so much i cant have a consistent internet connection so i cant use it sadly, offline use would be so appreciated, even with less stuff to use, sadly i know that wont happen soon	1

"Good BUT... STILL does not handle repeat events such as Daylight Savings Time change (i.e. setting a reminder for the second Sunday of March each year to change clocks that don't adjust automatically). Does not handle ""last day of the month"" reminders well. Also, the list should display an icon by repeating tasks. Backup options are very limited, does not handle integration with e.g. Dropbox. Otherwise it would be perfect for my needs."	0

I had an older version of this app on my previous phone and loved it. However, the usability has gone way down somewhere in between.... You need to get rid of the analog clock thing when adding reminders. It takes way too many finger taps than is necessary to set a simple reminder for a given task, and annoyingly resets to the current day and time every time you try to edit a reminder you have created. This is confusing and makes it hard to use this app on-the-go, which is when I need it most..	0

I downloaded this after seeing someone advertise it. Looked cool so I figured try it out, right? Until I downloaded and it prompted me for a subscription. Lady you are nuts. People rather by the paper agenda at the store for cheaper. You do not see the full texture of the book, it's an online planner on top of it. I'm not paying you for that. I downloaded a FREE calendar that does the exact same thing. Terrible marketing skills.	-1

I will change the review if you solve this problem. Edit :I will edit the review after you ll solve this problem. I send it an email also.	0
Only rated 2 stars because of the ability to sync with the calendar apps on the phone and the ability to cross out any tasks once finished. However, the app is fairly simple with tasks laid out like a shopping or to do list with the inability to edit the timings of tasks. I had set an appointment for 1:30 but the app had automatically set it for 10:00 am and not allowing me to edit it. Also, it would have been nice for the tasks to be laid out in calendar format with color-coding options.	-1

"Pretty good. Took a while to figure out how to set up a task. Too many steps/screens to set reminder time, recurrence etc. I feel those should all be on a single screen. After saving, I can't edit. All I get is a prompt screen to sign in or sign up. Great feature for some, but I don't need it. It would be nice if that feature was said to be mandatory in the play store listing. I wouldn't have wasted my time. 3 stars for the ""forced"" share and the many-stepped interface. Seems to be feature-rich."	0

1 week in. not bad. somewhat intuituve. I like this app so far for its thoughtful blend of simplicity and intuitive features that go beyond being a task list, & more into routine habits. some important features are hard to find or change after initial set up. my day planning activity 'anydo.moment': I could not find all week to modify... So, it was starting this important step at a difficult time of day to use. Many simmilar apps aim & claim to be useful but only achieve novelty.	1

Poor settings options. I tried to set a schedule for an entire day to be more productive. Kept getting emails for each task at the time I scheduled it. I also got notification pop-ups on my MacBook calendar app which seemed to sync itself with my Google calendar. I went to Google calendar to turn it off but it wouldn't let me. I had to delete all 10 emails, hide the notifications and now I will be uninstall this app. It should have an option to disable syncing. Nice idea. Lazy developers.	-1

Remainder app for free? That’s what I Thought this app was. Please don’t waste our time it is very disrespectful. For you to get people you say it’s for free the app and it’s not for free. Please don’t do that its not nice to delete apps because you say lies. Lies are not good and if you play with my trust and the world trust you are not helping the world to be a better place you are helping to continue destroy I don't want to open no more apps I don’t trust what they say	-1

I loved this app so much after I downloaded it and used it for about 2 weeks. Because I loved it so much I decided to purchase the pro full version and payed £4.99. However, it was not worth paying at all. I would have rather used the free version with the ads. I will recommend everyone to download the app and use the free version but dont get the £4.99 ad free version because it doesn't really give you anything extra. I would recommend the creator of the app to add more features for payed.	-1

This is the best time blocking app I've found, but it still has some significant pain points. I wish there was a desktop version, since creating/updating blocks would be 5x faster with a keyboard, mouse, and large screen. Editing would be faster too if blocks could temporarily overlap, and if routines were per day instead of per week.	1

Really frustrating experience. The list sharing is incredibly frustrating. My wife and I were on several lists together on wunderlist and when we transfered to this new app, we had to text message the lists we shared. She shared some of the same lists with me and now we have duplicate lists. It's completely FUBAR. We are abandoning the platform now to find something better.	-1

Real nice app. I like links to google calendar for events, reminders. Not sure about tasks. Have you guys thought about drag and drop between tasks and events? It'd be perfect for time blocking or scheduling tasks. Right now I use a zapier that takes new tasks in a specific list and lists them as 5 am on today's calendar. I'd like to drag them to certain times so my schedule doesn't fill up (shows time blocks as busy in Calendar). Thanks	1

Would be better if the Inbox was not treated as a project, but rather a scheduling location, and that items could be created in the inbox and EASILY (bulk) moved to other projects (but stay in the inbox) to then be scheduled to daily or next week or whatever Tracking would be easier. and the app would get a higher rating and I may actually subscribe.. Its a deal breaker for me.	-1

Great habit tracking tool. The widget on the home screen is a great size so I can see quickly how well I'm doing, and the options at set up are thorough. I'm tracking all sorts of things and it's easy to see how I'm doing. Highly recommended. Only concern is I'm having trouble getting a response on a _potential_ issue I have (not sure it's real yet, but if it is I'm concerned). Otherwise five stars.	1

I don't care for it, when I first opened it it showed me all these appointments. I was thinking what the heck then I figured out it was showing me weeks passed along with the current. To me that's just a bunch of clutter. Then it was telling me I had five appointments this month, no, only have one, it only showed the one but it still says 5. I don't have a clue what the other four are. Anytime I try to do anyting it practically begged me to join premium, I just uninstalled it.	-1

Just started hence neutral stars. I was going to write to the devs but I see you reply here. Open is good. I don't know what a filtered list is. That is my only confusion so far. I was interested in premium but put off by the monthly fee rather than a single license. Meanwhile I was playing with the idea of selling each premium feature separately. That would give you information about what your users want - especially after you add computer support. Feed the wolf you want, Linux 1st.	0

Updated: I want to love this but like others have said, it doesn't work with all calendars as claimed. To get Outlook or any other calendar to work, you have to have your calendar sync with Google, which not everyone wants or can do. It also only works with Google's smart watch, not Android Wear OS smart watches. Great look and idea, but very limited by being Google only.	-1

Wunderlist was just fine. Why the same in a new jacket done worse. Just because it has to be Microsoft? Microsoft, stop trying to be what others do better. Edge, why? Bing, why? Buy a good working app and make it worse, again. Why? As a UX designer to MS Business: stop trying to outperform others who already are market leaders. Start finding new solutions for new user problems and be the market leader there. If not, a Google will outperform you, because they understand user problems better.	-1

Over the years the platform has become stagnant. I was a huge proponent of Habitica, using it for a few years and even paying for a subscription to support development; but development beyond bug fixes never happened. It's a good tool with a potent gamification component, but they've failed to continue to make it engaging and interesting—and certainly not worth paying to support.	0

Super useful app! Really nice visual way to keep track of what you're doing that you shouldn't be doing, and what you're avoiding that you know you should be doing!

Also keeping track of when in sticking to my sleep and diet schedule, and a bunch of other habits I'm trying to establish. It's important to have a way to hold yourself accountable!

"Good app, but very buggy and support is completely unhelpful. There's no way to change your subscription level in the app or play store. Even if you cancel the app will think you're still subscribed. So basically when you pick a subscription level you are fully committed to it because the devs are too incompetent and uncaring to help. When using a choosing skill the habits n dailies show up like 10% of the time and the devs basically said ""oh well, we can't fix that"" when I mentioned it."	-1
you must ask the Cubs fans. I can`t fathom it myself.	-1
I have used this awesome app for 3 years at least. Sleek, convenient, powerful. But the recent updates just bring more and very intrusive ads.

Indeed this is probably to be the best tasks app on Google Play. Super flexible and user friendly and yet somehow simple at the same time. I love how the developer thought of, well, everything, you could need really. There is no desktop version yet to sync between computer and phone. I would love to be the first to know when it's ready, because when I am home (well all of us really thanks to the coronavirus at the moment) I prefer to open up my laptop to add tasks because it would be done faster that way. Thank you Stephen Nottage!	1

A negative experience. I wasn't using it and forgot about it until it was renewing. I didn't port it over to a new phone and it seems you can't cancel the app except through the app. This means I would have to install it on my new phone, give it permission to access my information, then cancel the subscription and uninstall it. Other apps on my phone with subscriptions I can cancel through Google Play. Apparently not this one.	-1

This app looks great and most of the functions seem to be very practical. There isn't any Windows or browser-based version for usage on a computer, is it? If not, is something in planning?

Enjoying the app so far, but the widgets are quite limiting. You cannot use check lists in the widgets, and sometimes they update rather weirdly. I have also had UI bugs throughout, but they haven't affected me too much. Overall good, but just needs some tweaking to make it more solid. That's not to say the service is bad. Just the mobile app.	0

Overall good and useful.

It's simple to use: you don't need to be a coder to figure it out. I like that there's a message board. I am considering using it to form a support group so I can stay on track with my workouts. Also, I didn't realize there are a lot of people who hate themselves for masturbating lol. But it's good they can find support in the message board. I read that you can only have 5 habits you can track. I'm being pragmatic and starting out with 4. But eventually I will need more than 5.	1

I wanted to give the app more stars as I love the concept, but it's so buggy. Especially with the dailies feature... all the dailies are linked together somehow. There are some things I do Mon-Sat for instance, but not on Sundays. But when I set a task to not repeat on Sunday, it sets all tasks that way. Very frustrating.	0

I have used many habit trackers over the years, but this was the one that most suited me. It's simple and effective, and even the free version is really useful, the only drawback (for the free version) would be that you cannot track more than 5 habits, but I don't want to follow that many habits either way so it was a perfect match for me!	1

I've tested dozens of habit and routine tracking apps. The clean layout, useful widgets, and versatility of this one puts it above the rest. Even without premium, it is highly functional.

"Best to do app 1. You don't have to pay for the main things There no things to buy already 2. It is simple 3. Design is fantastic 4.

I kinda miss the old system where time-specific trees styles were the thing. Now you can pick anything after focusing for 10 minutes. It actually takes away incentive to study / focus longer. Nitpick 1: the bracketed (week) has no space after the day, example Monday(week), instead of Monday (Week). Nitpick 2: sharing. It would be nice to share more than just an image of the forest. Perhaps some tree stats? Much like there is underneath the forest itself.	0

This app has been very helpful in the past. I haven't enjoyed the most recent update, though. Hence the 3 stars. If I close the forest app so it's not an open tab, it doesn't send me back to the forest anymore. I haven't changed any permissions, it's all exactly the same. It allows me to bypass the system, which isn't helpful at ALL. Please figure it out with the next update. I would like my forest app back	0

Pretty solid app, does what it seems, but one problem for me is that the alarms don't go off when they're supposed to. Instead of going off at the time I set, they all go off next time I open the app. They never go off until I open the app, so they're useless.	-1
I got Taks to replace Todoist. Later, I deleted Tasks and went back to Todoist. Still not happy, I brought back Tasks and now run both apps side by side on my phone. Perfect solution. Todoist carries the heavyweight must-do daily work load. I refer to it two, maybe three times a day. But Tasks is there to be fleet of foot and versatile - a quick list here, a few to dos there. Adding to and ticking off right throughout the day. That is my way. But Tasks would be a great stand-alone app too!	1

Not as good as Wunderlist. Simple things make it less usable than its predecessor such as: 1. sharing internet page to a list and the list defaults to My Day instead of one of your choice or the last one you opened - makes adding lots of pages in a row slow. 2. Add new task from the widget puts it at the bottom of the list not the top. 3. Marking a task with a star doesn't move it to the top of the list. Other than that it looks smart and imported my old Wunderlist lists on 2nd attempt.	0

The app is broken right now. Downloaded today to try it out and the first two slides were blank. Character creation is all blank. Unfortunately deleted but was looking forward to trying.

Todoist has 1 big flaw that really prevents me to use it well: if you schedule a task to be repeated daily and do it few minutes after midnight it will skip a day. Overdue tasks that are completed should add the repeat time to the previous date not be reset to the day they are marked compete!!	-1

I'm also planning to start using it for my Getting Things Done system (David Allen), which I currently have in Evernote. It's a huge win for me!!	1

This is everything I ever wanted out of a app without all the headaches and frustration and learning curve. If could have built an app for this project for work you would have been this exact same app. I always of some grand idea of what I want and can never find something quite right and end up very disappointed. It becomes too difficult to figure out how to use the program or its just too simple and not professional enough. You nailed it with this app and made Excel look just silly!!	1

What can I do? Update: seems to work now! Thanks!	1
I've been wanting a habit tracker that is fun and this definitely is. There are a few loading issues every so often, if those bugs weren't there I'd give 5 stars. All around though enjoyable, easy to use, and a great way to keep track of good and bad habits.	1

"Mar 2020: Very, very disappointing. Looking elsewhere. Before:A move forward from Wunderlist? Not! MS made sure the UI looked different (with useless themes) and DROPPED Wunderlist functionality like 1) email delivery (marked stuff in Outlook is USELESS to people that don't use it), 2) no way to add tasks by widget/notifications, 3) marking a task with a star doesn't move it to the top, 4) ""My Day"" shows up rather than a task list. 5) ... (out of review space) I detest ""progress"" that isn't."	-1
I like this app a lot, it is refreshing but to be 5 stars I should have more flexibility in setting intervals, like selecting days of the week so I can have work and nonwork day schedules that easily repeat. When I add something to a schedule a 10min before alarm should not be default, I'm using the app to plan my day primarily. Finally each new entry should default its begin time to the last entry's end time, with the new end time shortly after, say 30 min later. That would be a 5 star app.	0

However, having paid for the premium version, I find it annoying beyond belief that I get pop-ups every 2 weeks asking me to leave a review. So, developers, I've left one but you've lost 1.5 stars for spamming me with these requests. This shouldn't happen in a paid app without any opportunity to turn off these notifications.	0

The app idea is quite great. The app itself needs to be improved thought. The clock keeps getting stuck on fixed times and updates the time only when we open the app itself. This defeats the whole purpose of the app. Definitely a 5 star idea. Needs better execution.	0

I like the idea, but does no one else have serious concerns about privacy? Yes, the required permission to monitor your usage of other apps seems reasonably well-motivated by the stated purpose of classifying your phone usage as focused vs unfocused phone. But on further consideration, that' actually a ton of information to sign away in exchange for growing some digital trees. I'll just stick to a simple timed alarm until I see some assurance that our usage data isn't being sold to 3rd parties.	0

Used to be simple well organized app. Latest update was a major step backwards and makes it unusable and completely unreliable. Do not trust them with your data.... Most of my prior history of completed tasks disappeared. For some reason timed ones seemed to stick around... Completed tasks are now automatically hidden and lose any order you had them in. If you ever care to reference completed tasks in any structure this app is not for you. It's a hot mess now for that. And their backups do not include completed tasks. They claim all your information is backed up securely but when I asked for my completed tasks they were not able to provide my attachments.	-1

"Good app but don't bother with premium. I bought premium for the ""powerful widgets"" and ability to track extra habits. Don't bother. The widgets are nothing special and if you read the tips section the developer even says it's best to only track a few habits at a time! After feeling ripped off I emailed the developer twice requesting a refund but have received no reply. Great free app but don't waste your money on premium."	-1

Update on Oct 29: The new update with sections and the new UX design is a real drop of usability in my case. My day to day work force me to constantly change priority, project and other properties and with the new version, the natural language as been removed when editing a task. I will strongly consider not renewing my subscription because todoist was my workhorse because of that natural language. Original review : It's my day to day to do application to drive all my tasks.	-1
"1 star bc I was forced to change apps yet there are no meaningful improvements from Wunderlist but boy are there downgrades! Harder to share lists with my husband, syncing is spotty, didn't improve the calendar view to let you see your schedule, the My Day only allows you to manually add one task at a time by opening each task and moving it. I have to manually add it if it's due ""today""?! This is a HUGE flop! Killed Wunderlist and now I have to pay for a different app that actually works"	-1
I've tried other calendars, and I just love the layout. If only the widget layout can be changed when first opened. But it shows everything I need very easily. I can share my calendar with other people. I can change the colors. Another recommendation is to gain more colors for the appointments. :) Overall, super happy. Will not be choosing another calendar!	1
so-so. not as intuitive right off but fine after a little of fiddling around. but the free version only tracks 5 habits and i dont love it enough to see the value in paying for it since there are other apps out there that satisfy the same thing.	0

In my opinion this is The Best task management tool out there. FYI: I've tried Todoist, Nirvana, Notion, Microsoft To-Do, Wunderlist, Google Tasks, Any.Do. None of these apps had that many features that worked so well together as in TickTick. I use this app to plan my every day, and It's awesome! I don't have much money atm (pun intended) and can't get the premium, but free plan is offering so many features that it doesn't hinder my performance here, unlike in other apps.	1

Great Tasks and Reminder app. The dev has been responsive and implementa suggestions. Looking forward to further updates. Waiting for the web app and list sharing..EDIT: I believe this to be a 5star app, and will be once completed with the web app and list sharing. If it is 5 stars now, then there is no room for improvement. In Jan you stated in coming weeks, so it should be soon, we hope. Thank you for a great app. Looking forward to completion.

App is very good for what it is, but the sync feature stopped working for me. The FAQ says it's due to a rooted phone but this happened twice on non-rooted phones. HabitBull offers no support to fix. 2 stars bec it works standalone, but if you need syncing know there's a risk of permanent failure.	-1
I LOVE CHICAGO. Tonight was AMAZING!!	1
Don't go for premium , then you have to make sure the data sync is upto date Everytime before you start the app and it is not possible unless you have good speed wifi wherever you go.	-1

Edit: Initially gave it 4.5 stars. The app itself still works fine, but the sync stopped working about a year ago. That's the main reason I paid for the premium version. I messaged the developer about it and never heard back. Wonder if it's been abandoned by the developer?	-1

I have been using this premium version of app from past 6 months and its really great, but i still believe there are few feature still missing in it to make things easy. Like there should be dashboard which gives details of all habbits progress in bar percentage marked successful. Currently you have to go to each habbit and check the status. So a centralized section giving more details on the progress would be helpful like it is in Habbit tracker app. Also a dynamic habbit counter could be added	1

Looks cool and I like the stats. I would like to have a monthly and yearly calendar display on which dates with non-repeating tasks scheduled are bold or otherwise highlighted, or preferably have the tasks listed in small font in the box for that day in monthly view. And when you click on the date have all tasks for that day display. Why do none of the life rpg apps I've tried not have calendars?

App is okay, but BA can still enhance this app by adding more features to make it more user friendly. For example: allow the user to drag and drop tasks to their desired schedule or list.	0
It seems like it could be good but very disappointed that it's subscription based and that there's not a one time purchase option. Not sure if pro has this option but it also doesnt seem to have a history of completed tasks. Will need to keep looking.	0

I'm a student and was looking for something get myself very organized. I have tried series of productivity apps before. Apparently this had one of the features i have always been looking for; integration with other apps which I love. Two things I found disappointing, features are extremely limited without premium, it's almost impossible to use like that also very expensive. I couldn't find statistics; from totally hours and other reports	-1

Decent app. Fun concept. Biggest issue right now is that some of the dailies that are supposed to be once per week are still showing up as an every-day task, which is very annoying. Sometimes the dailies will cross over into the to-do list for an hour or so at a time, too.	0
Perfect App for what it is made for, I even.purchased premium so I could add more habits and also get the dark mode option. I am a Music Producer and if anybody does any form of creative art for a living then you will know how easy it is to get carried away and spend hours doing that. This app has helped me to stay on top of other tasks such as eating healthy spending time with my pets and going to the gym everyday. So Thank You!!! God Bless and have a great day.

This app is amazing. I use it to show all my Google calendar events as sectors on a 24 hour clock. I just have one feedback, I wish there was an option to divide the clock into two colored sector, based on from when sunlight is available and when it's not. The idea of ligh/dark period seems more practical than the usual AM/PM. Or maybe, provide a custom rotation to the dial, for eg., i would want the day to start from the time I go to bed. And thanks for this great app. Highly recommended.	1

It was good but I guess Google is sabotaging it, so I lost a couple of notifications. Removed it and started using Google calendar and notifications are now ok. Sorry. I have uninstalled the program since I missed an important appointment I can no longer trust it. Probably the solution you provide works, but I think it you should force the user to check those settings on start so one doesn't miss appointments.	-1

Much better since my last review in 2015. Right now, easily the best to-do app out there. All the issues I faced back then, are gone. One thing that makes this a 4-star (above average) app rather than 3 (average), is the automatic inclusion of past-due tasks in Today-list. Of course, if it's past due, it has to be due today. Somehow most to-do apps miss this. 5-stars will be when(or if) they actually release the google assistant integration and it actually works without issues. That Zapier-stuff, though.... what a joke. If anyone has the time to deal with that, they have plenty of extra time and have no need for a to-do app. Also, including zapier as a premium feature, with zapier itself requiring an expensive subscription to actually work, is a pretty damn dick move. Yea, just thought about this again, and this dick move costs 1 star. Pay $10 for a 1 star extra DLC!	0

Great app for the most part. Functionality is amazing. Sync is great. But, I really hate that this app puts itself on top of whatever I'm doing every 5 minutes exactly.

Replacing Wunderlist that I've used for years. Syncing lists not working reliably so it's useless for me. Switching to Todoist instead.	-1
Looks polished app but time after time new issues come up. Raising these issues with the developer rarely gets timely response or interest in fixing it (I'm a paid user). Today, tasks lost their subtasks on one device, while the 2nd device is OK (for now) || to devs: Task (and their subs) used to sync across devices via Google Drive.. Seems like you eliminated this feature by switching to Google Tasks in your recent update. Totally useless app now for me (at least)	-1
A little buggy sometimes but all is forgiven for how much this app helps me be a more productive and motivated person. I have one request, please add some sort of real life stat tracker. The idea would be to assign tasks, habits, or dailies to certain skill categories and you could track points, levels, or hours for certain skills. For example, this would be cool for me to keep track of my progress towards mastery as a woodworker or painter etc.	1

The best app in the market for improving your daily habits. I researched many Habit apps in Play store and finally concluded that this is the best one. I changed my self a lot by regulary monitoring my habits through HabitNow App. The user interface is superb and quite simple. Also it provides habit statistics up to date. You can also enter your habits according to the category like Health, nutrition etc..A must have App for everybody!!	1

I have never seen a more beautifully designed calendar+planner app. Easy on eyes, strikes a great balance between functionality and simplicity (Google and Microsoft calendar apps should take inspiration from this) and ... just great.

I love all the recent changes you have made - especially the ability to undo things in the history. Could you please add an option to manually reorder tasks? I would like to put mine in the order that I do them throughout the day, and none of your sorting allows that. Thanks! Update: it's been 22 months since you said you'd make drag and drop sorting an option. I see monthly updates but not the one feature that would make this app user friendly. Don't promise what you won't deliver.	-1

"I truly, literally, honestly would not be able to keep track of my life without this app. I have seven calendars and a task list synced to my device. I'm able to color code each calendar and appointments within those calendars, plus add emojis if I need an appointment to ""pop."" The android widget is fantastic (mine is set as my home screen so I always see what's coming up). Cannot recommend this app more highly. I would give 50 stars if the option was available."	1
This is a poor imitation of Wunderlist, not even missing the features that made Wunderlist a killer app, but then soon be bad design choices were made in the port. WHY do you have to scroll to the bottom to add items? WHY is there no API to tie into? Thoroughly disappointed.	-1

I have enjoyed this calendar for 9mths so much so I paid to go Pro, now 3weeks on it no longer syncs events older than two weeks and I need to refer back further. The app blames google for the limitations but I now have another calendar that syncs back 3yrs so nothing to do with google. There used to be an option on BC to syncs all events past and future but this option is no longer available. Really disappointed as was a good app, see how you get on but don't waste your money upgrading like I did 🙁	0

I was reluctant at first to use this app but now absolutely love it. It's simple yet effective to track your habits and keep on top of to-do list. Truly one of the best app I have used (& I seldom say or write any comments). However, just one niggly point would be the alarm where it doesn't seem to do anything even if I choose to have alarm on the Reminder function. If this could be resolved, it would be awesome and would just go premium!	1

If you want something that syncs to your calendar, you are in luck! It really is beautiful and such a wonderful idea. However my 3 star review comes from the fact you can't use it without syncing to your calendar, and there by having it affect your calendar. I was hoping to use this as an hourly time management tool, much like a block system, but I can't have it be that AND have my calendar be a place for just appointments. It makes the actual calendar look too full and messy. Basically in short, can you please add an offline tool as well?	0

1/5/20) I have tried the updates since my original post, and launch speed has slightly improved. Main Landing Page loads very slowly, but at least didn't crash right away again. Almost froze when scrolling through habits. I gave it more time to load, then tried going to a different section of the app & it crashed.. 11/9/19) Would be an awesome app, if it would load. Painfully slow startup and very laggy in app as a well. (Android 9 ; Moto G6 Play) Please fix! & I will actually update my review.	-1
The design is nice but it doesn't understand when I said 'later'. When I said remind me tomorrow morning, it replied okay I'll be reminded tomorrow at 16:00+. That's afternoon.

For years I didn't like digital calendars. They didn't offer me the overview I liked of physical calendars and notebooks. I was very sceptical of digital ones and their cumbersome features and options - writing something down with a pen seemed sooo much quicker and more direct. Then I saw a friend using Business Calendar and immediately I was intuitively drawn to its good overview of events, simple access to features and quick but precise 'taking a note'/'making an entry'.	1

Well I like having an agenda where, if needed, I can be reminded of what I need to do. However, I am not liking how after 3-5 days of reminders, it just stops doing it and I have to go in in order to refresh. At this point a normal calendar app preinstalled would be better, since I can set it to remind me every day. Could this be fixed?	1

I have hope that this app will get a lot closer to the superior Wunderlist so I'll change my review when it does, but for now here are my biggest concerns: I really don't like how 'my day' doesn't automatically include things due 'today'. Also when moving a task to a list it's annoying because the lists are not shown under their folders. I'd also like to see a 'my week feature'. Also two lists can't have the same name even though I have them in different folders.	-1

A very good rip-off of LifeRPG—taking all of the useful features of task management, reward motivation, and RPG-style stat levels, and making the UI simpler and more user-friendly.

"Update: After I read the reply I redownloaded this app. Waste of $4.25! It's NOT WORTH ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY! Not a lot of extras to charge money AND it's only cute on a computer. The ""lists"" are not very easy to make and I never did find the ""meal plan"" or journal parts. The goal part is not on the app. Any.do is FREE and a lot easier for lists with reminders and also includes a calendar. Not worth the cost. Yeah it's cute but not as easy to use as other free calendars. Pretty disappointed..."	-1

It's an amazing app, i love it and find it extremely useful. Just discovered it recently and totally enjoying the productivity it gives me. I very much like the simplicity compared to other To-Do apps with too cluttered UI. Miscoroft ToDo on the other hand is perfectly balanced! One small thing i would personally want to see is the ability to assign more levels of priority, not just 'Important' and the rest. There could be importance levels like 'A', 'B', 'C' etc, or some color-coding, for example. Thanks and keep up the great work!!!!!! Microsoft on Android is doing a great job!	1

The idea is wonderful. But a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression. For example, information is slowly updated even within the application, often clicking on a menu item is ignored. If you create a task without a title, but with a list, it will become closed for editing, just delete. Not all things are obvious. I had to read help to solve simple questions. Well, the old-school 8-bit graphics - not everyone likes it.	-1

"Really nice clean UI and smooth UX, not laggy at all. You can divide tasks in groups and sub groups, and attach a due date to it and tell you when the task is overdue. The second best thing about this app is the ""plan"" app feature. The feature shows what task you have planned for the day and shows you the task one by one and lets you pick when to do it. Very nice feature but how many times you can plan your tasks is limited in the free version. I wish there's an integrated ""Habit App""feature"	1

It seems like this app is no longer supported. I've paid for premium, but sync stopped working several months ago, and developers have not replied to a support request.

Simple, no B.S. habit tracking. Forming a habit is hard, and it makes sense to track your progress for multiple reasons. Some apps and methods are almost as hard to use as the habit you are trying to create is to make. Not HabitBull.

I've turned off every notification option I can find and I still get pop up reminders on my screen. I just want a silent reminder in my notification bar. Can't tell you how many times a reminder has popped up during a call and I can't press the end button to hang up. Or accidently clicked the reminder while trying to do something else on my phone. Please give an option or tell me where to find it for notifications WITHOUT a popup on the screen that steals focus on whatever I'm working on.	0

reply to developer: whatsapp continues to run in background and show notifications even after being closed. why are you unable to do that? .. original comment: I paid $4 for the reminders. However, reminders work only when the application is active. If you exit / shut-down the application, no reminders for you. Developer should design the application in such a way that it continues to run in background even when user exits it. I would like to have my money back unless this problem is rectified.	-1

Revised review: Sometimes we seek out apps to help with deficiencies or make life work out. App was so great and so functional for months, until a few days ago. I was working around the changed, now cumbersome, reschedule/edit/rename tasks process. But Labels beyond a few characters are hidden now. Todoist Labels was The Thing for this app for me, with efficiently visually seeing/grouping tasks. Had made app ahead of many others. App needs more display settings then...to be usable again.	-1

The app looks nice, but being forced to move over from Wunderlist, the import data functionality only working after the 5th try (after two weeks) and the web version literally becoming unresponsive when I load it, tells me this app is not in any way finished or ready to be used. I don't trust it to not lose my data, so I can't use it. Thankfully, other apps can import from Wunderlist as well...	-1

I love the concept of the app BUT it needs a big update to change the interface, which makes it difficult for the user to interact with the app in a fun way.

Bad transfer from Wunderlist. Resharing lists is time consuming. Order of items on lists is not preserved. Looks like it at first until you add something to a list and then it appears at the end/bottom of the list not at the top. Must then sort by order of creation date which throws everything out of wack if you had items ordered by importance or any other custom order.	-1
i just wanna say happy mother`s day to all the mommy`s out there	1

UPDATE: I know it's a one time fee as stated, that I had already paid. Same acct now I don't have pro. I've had it for a while now and had purchased the pro version right away. My reason for giving 2 star now is all of a sudden it tells me I do t have the pro feature anymore that is supposed to be a 1 time payment. 😠 Also, if there was a desktop version that would be majorly useful! Disappointed that I would have to pay for pro again if I wanted to continue those features.	-1

This app doesnt require your firstborn in order to function as similar apps do. The Quick post function is great. However, unlike other similar apps, this doesnt have a widget feature to show what the upcoming daily task is on the screen. So for me, that is really unfortunate. If this changes, I will gladly give this a perfect rating.	0

I like this app so much. It's user interface is simple and easy to use. In addition, it's a versatile app as it combines the features of many different applications, for instance, it's a to-do list, pomodoro, and a habit tracker. All in one. It has helped me alot to organise my life and I really appreciate it, so it deserves the 5 stars. I recommend this app to everyone.	1

Perfect to do app. Wish it integrated with chrome though, would be nice to have it on my desktop.	1
like to check off sub-task via widget without opening app. (checking off task without subtasks works fine). Wish widget showed calendar. Wish app had daily, weekly, monthly, yearly trends, wish app to sync to google calendar. Would be nice if you could rearrange the components of a list (ex:move Note below subtasks ) Btw, 3 of 5 is to me a STRONG like. You guys are doing a great job.	0

I have been in and out of this app many a times. It was all my fluctuating mind, not the app. The app is super special. I bought the pro version this time and opt to stick to it forever. Best wishes for the developers♥️.	1

I love the ability to combine calendars and task lists. It is very customizable and easy to use. I would love an option to have it on my computer as well and be able to sync them together. There are many widgets and they are very customizable as well.	1
I enjoyed using Habitbull in the past and decided to give it another go. Not a lot has changed. I do like the app, very simple to use and gives great reminders.	1
Woke up after about 6 hours of sleep. Feeling better now	1
Great app to plan out your weekly schedule, especially for a college student. However I wish it would show the amount of time being spent on each activity on the widget. It shows it when you go into the app but that's less convenient and helpful if you want to do a quick check to see how much time you have for today's lunch break.	1

I've loved using this calendar for years. My favorite feature is the bar view in the month calendar. I haven't found any other calendar app that does it this well. But recently they ruined the free version by showing full-screen pop-up ads that play for up to 15 seconds before you can get back to your work. I may have paid for the full version before they did this, but not now. If they're going to force uses to pay up $7 to remove such intrusive ads, I'll just move on to another app.	-1

I'm editing my review due to the new update. Dear todoist, the new update made it nontrivial to change the project of a task on the app. I have to click on the three dots then on move project. This should be as simple as changing the label. Please, be so kind to the users and fix this. .... Great app, does exactly what I need it to do. Extremely simplistic and elegant, yet functional design. I would tweak one little thing or too, but overall todoist is almost a perfect product.	0

Overall, I like the app. However, I'm uninstalling because of the pop-up notification that goes over other apps and basically freezes my phone until i dismiss it. The app doesn't have permission to draw over other apps and no way to disable this notification. The only reason it isn't 1 star is because overall the app is good.. they just ruin it with that 'feature'.	0

I think it's by far one of the best apps out there. It integrates well with the default calendar app, and really helps you to track your day. Tons of customizable buttons, and even the clock face itself from the hour/minute arms colour and thickness/length, to the placement of the numbers on the clockface. I love how it displays the time remaining to your next meeting, task or alarm. Widget is pretty good and you have full functionality from the comfort of your home screen. Lock Screen display??	1

Despite lacking a few features I'd love (Google Calendar integration, please!) this is the best to-do app I've used. It's efficient, without complexities that muddy its usefulness. The highlight for me is a *compact* task list widget, which allows me to quickly view a large number of tasks on my home screen without scrolling. Unfortunately a recent update has made its notifications insufferable - and I can't turn them off! Sadly I may have to uninstall and cancel if this isn't fixed soon.	0

I love the concept & look of this mobile app & the desktop version. I wish I could set recurring tasks or add time reminders to tasks. You also can't set reminders if you add an event directly into Artful Agenda. You have to add it to your Google calendar first to set the reminder then let it sync to Artful Agenda. I've paid for the year subscription & I'm really hoping it has more functionality by the end of my subscription or I won't be renewing.	1

So far so good, app is great. Helps me mostly keep track of what I need to do, not make sure I do it. make it more aggressive. Wish it had a daily reminder that would just pop up to remind me of all my most recent tasks at the start of the day that i could dismiss, just to remind me. So I dont have to wait for each task to remind me on or before the due date. Also when a task is completed it seems to keep reminding me in pop up until I go to the task and scroll to the completed button.	1

"Near to ideal. But there is some shortage. For example there is no option in settings to add planned tasks to ""My Day"" automatically. Or people usually plan tonight for tomorrow. But when i at the end of the they add tasks to ""My Day"" they add to today not tomorrow. There is must be an optional boundary time in settings that determine the end of day and after that adding tasks to My Day"" go to tomorrow. Another thing, i cant add ""step""s to ""My Day"" its important."	0

"Al migrar de Wunderlist encontré varios elementos. 1) en las listas compartidas se duplicaron las tareas. 2) en el widget no hay indicador de tareas vencidas, en Wunderlist se mostraba la fecha en rojo. Esto último sí se muestra en To Do pero dentro de la aplicación y no en el widget. Ese indicador visual hace falta. 3) hay mayor configuración del widget de Wunderlist. 4) las tareas vencidas de la lista ""Planned"" no se muestran organizadas por fecha de vencimiento. Aún no me voy a pasar a To Do."	0

I just started but really like it so far. Competes directly with Habitica but less of the nonsense costumes. It's hard at first to sort characteristics, skills and tasks (you are essentially your own game dev) but on paper I recently sorted out what I want to improve (Skills) and what is stopping me (Characteristics). Tasks will follow soon after. I'm really hopeful about this setup, I love the design, and I never do this but I might actually pay for a subscription (!!!) if all goes well.	1

this is actually a really good app. I just have a couple of suggestions that make things a little more helpful 1. to be able to rearrange the habits or tasks by the time we have it set so it will look like more of a daily schedule instead of just a list 2. a button that goes with when you want to do your habit or task have it be more specific just in case we want to break our task or habit up and do half earlier in the day and the other half like drinking water or studying.	1

Mostly a good app, helps me keep on top of things. Morning notifications are a bloody lifesaver. My only criticisms are that the free version is rather lacking in basic features, at least for people like me coming from other apps. Also the top bar and the system status bar when in the app are different colors, slightly, and that's always bugged me.	1

"Best watch once you understand it. It takes a while to set up just the way you want it and to actually ""get it"", but once you do it does exactly what it promises. Its sleek yet informative and by far the best ""at a glance"" app for your homescreen. The watch addon is the cherry on the cake. Only improvement in my opinion would be to add multiple different widgets. Like give me the option for a small simple one on my home screen and a bigger more detailed one on my office screen for instance."	1

I currently use wunderlist to organize all my tasks. It would be nice to have integration with their software because G tasks is so bare bones. Also, because of the limitations of the free software, I can't tell if the full version would integrate into my workflow because this app prohibits use of projects.	0
What I am missing the most is, that I can´t open it directly in web browser just with my login without installing anything. In big industry companies is not alowed to install anything, what is not fully authorized by central IT department. I used Wunderlist in my browser (app in chrome was possible to install without any permission), but I can´t use it now in my work browser. Just in my private smartphone. By transferring wunderlist tasks some old and completed tasks are transferred as uncompleted. So, 3 stars for now.	0

Its a great app I used for years. I was ok with ads, but the full screen can't be immediately banished ads make it unusable. When I need Calendar info, I need it RIGHT NOW. I'll give it a couple of weeks but if it doesn't go back to discrete corner ads I'm out. Edit post response: I'd have paid a couple of bucks for ad free version, because it is better than stock Calendar. But its not 7 bucks better. So if you're not going to remove full screen ads, after years of using, gotta say buh bye...	-1

Eh. it's mediocre and really doesn't do anything your calendar app on your phone doesn't already do. I liked using the month widget until it just decided, on Jan 29, that the month of February no loger existed. I tried to look ahead to the month of Feb to see a preview from the widget but it kept going fron Jan to March. The only way to view Feb in the widget was to change the date to Feb in my phone. just went back to my phone's calendar app. Uninstalling.	-1

I wish I could give it 5 stars. Only thing missing is a Windows/Linux app for syncing, which I can't do without, and that's the only thing keeping me away. I would happily pay for that feature. If you just need an Android app, no need to look elsewhere. It has everything you can ask for. The UI is great, and very intuitive.	1

Has been one of the best reminder app available for a long time. This most recent update messed up notifications on Android 10. They don't follow the system dark mode at all, instead you have to manually change it in the app or deal with mismatched colors. It looks ridiculous seeing a white notification background amidst other black backgrounds in dark mode. It also looks like the black is not a true black like other apps. If this isn't fixed soon, I'll be looking for a new reminder app.	-1
I really like the app, but you need to fix the reminders, they don't work. It doesn't pop up on time, and sometimes not at all.	0

The concept is good but the execution lacks. There are constant issues with server sync, and since the server side has priority, updates I make on the phone regularly get wiped out. Every so often the app will prompt me to log in again when I open it...this time it just kicked me out while I was actively using it and updating a list, made me log in again, and didn't keep anything I had already done! My wife already gave up on it and I will probably look elsewhere too	-1
Good app and I like the setups that are already prepared for when u log in. My problem with the app is that it's too overwhelming. Too many things to manage and for my easily distracted and anxious brain it's too much. As constructive that can actually be applied--please make it so the tasks actually leave the list ocne they are completed. Some are infinite and its difficult to focus on what needs to be done. Otherwise. Good job on this app it's well made.	0

Starting maybe in September I've started having issues. I will add an event to the calendar (which is synced to google), but within a few days the event will get cancelled (w/out notice of course). I can appreciate that the problem stems from Google sync. Nonetheless the problem is serious as it has to do with the chore use of the application. Anyway, I personally still use the app as the visualisation is still way better than Google's. So for me that still beats the major con.	0

I went from touching the app once a day to once a week, over the span of about 2 months. Would be better if notifications were functional/ could be enabled. I like the concept of being a hero, though. I just always fail all my daily set tasks (repeatedly back to level 0 hahaha...) -- I stick to my sticky notes app (with reminders) that I've been using for years. [Edit 11/10/19]: I see notifications on appear on my phone now! Thank you.	0
Please help. Relogging in after several months disuse. It has asked me to enter a username and it's stuck on 'username taken'. Will not let me progress to the app. I've tried every random letter/number combination so it's definitely not taken. Just buggy app?	-1

THE BEST TODO APP I'VE EVER USED 100/10 WOULD RECOMMEND!!!	1
#NAME?	1
I have the premium version. I had been using Wunderlist. The most amazing Todo app ever and very intuitive. Tick Tick has worked well as Wunderlist is no longer supported. However some key things I truly miss. Push notifications when someone texts within the app. Notification that someone else has updated or completed a task or list. Copy and paste everything I need into a section as a single item in the list instead of everything becoming its own item in a list.	0
Looks good but it doesn't sync with events from existing calendars. It only syncs the holiday calendar but not my personal calendar.	-1

This is a great app...helps me a lot...but I have 2 problems: 1.the app doesn't give notifications on time when the time is up.....it used to give proper notifications before...but for the past 2 weeks it doesn't sound on time. 2. another problem is that I'm not getting the coins I earned ! Sometimes when the notification doesn't come (as described above) I don't get any coins and the timer resets itself without awarding me my coins. I request you to fix these 2 problems as soon as possible !	1
The app is helpful and has nice features. I would give 5 stars but you apparently you are not able to transfer your lists to another device, unless you have exactly the same version. I had to create all my lists from scratch.	0

"meh I left the ""meh"" on 2/2019. Today is 3/2020. While the calendar is ok, the ""themes"" never change and, really, are not anything of interest. They really need to be completely changed. Also, color coding helps me keep track of a lot of things I have going on...the measley 7 or 8 colors they have are TOO FEW & what?! No pink?? (A nice hot pink so it will stand out). I mean, idk, I'm still just meh... 😕"	-1
Pretty good app to take notes and lists, +1 for the smart Snooze feature. However it's disappointing that there's no reliable way of backing up all your data, even with Premium. The only option is to log in using a browser and manually export a backup, but an automated scheduled export within the app would be way better.	0
I love colorful horsies!	1
I'm obsessed with this app. I LOVE that you can make separate checklists for different types of tasks. I love having the ability to categorize my tasks/chores so I don't end up getting overwhelmed by the long list. Not only that, but you can sort your lists by due date, priority, or in alphabetical order and set tasks to repeat on certain days of the week instead of every so many days. The widgets are gorgeous and it's so easy to use the checklists without opening the app. I've never been so on top of things. Oh AND the calendar links to Google so I don't ever have to worry about losing or transferring events. This app is exactly what I've been looking for. I'm so glad I finally found it!!	1
Not looking forward to this long trip in the morning. I`m sick	-1
haha me tooooo! I miss you I havnt seen you in ages	-1
Love for scheduling but MORE for grocery lists!	1
i miss everyone... i need faces , not witty situational updates, but these will do...	1
great night! great peolple!	1
Headache is gone,thank god!Time for tea i think	1
This is a good app with somewhat helpful widgets. The widget calendar should include tasks on individual days. Events and their notification settings are lacking. If I want to be notified 2 weeks in advance, I simply can't.. In Google Calender, I can set it 4 weeks in advance. With this app I have to set the event date 1 week before it happens and set the notification to 1 week in advance in order to get 2 week notice. These restrictions are a dealbreaker.	-1
I really like the app but there is one feature that is to do but which syncs with Microsoft account use the Microsoft to do list because it sync very well with my laptop and also because it has the black theme. I would also prefer to have business calender on the web	0

Tried making a simple to do list. Was gone when I went back later	-1
So far so good but two improvements would allow me to delete the other planner app I have on my phone. 1) Reminders. I am looking for an app that would act like a print planner where I would list my tasks by day for the future. I'd like to be able to check an app for Mon., Tue, Weds., etc but without having to set a specific reminder for each. Monday should just be Monday without needing to set a time. Would be great to just have a list for the whole day. 2) For lists such as grocery lists, I don't see any setting to allow the app to stay on screen if you are currently in a store and trying to buy off your list. This is important!! No one wants to grocery shop and have to constantly unlock their screen to see the list.	0
ohhh ok. so like, it`s more frustrating? I had my hands on a 3g iphone last week but it was upgraded so i couldn`t unlock it	-1

The most intuitive app ever! Over the years I've tried numerous self-management techniques and apps, but this is the best by far. I love that it combines so many personal productivity functions in one, including Pomo timers, Kanban boards, habit tracker, smart reminders etc. Best by far is the minimalist, flexible calendar. The devs have done an incredible job! Update: Months later and I still love this and use it daily :)	1

Instead of the text, the whole box is in the chosen colour. - Quicker synchronisation with windows Keep up the great work!	1

This is an excellent application. The interface is fresh and new, and provides a new way to look at your day. I only wish that it could be made to be resized a little larger, as well as show all day events below in a list format as they are small around the bezel. Apart from that, it is a solid 5 stars!!	1
really enjoyed the podcast with This was my 1st time listenening to the show. Will def listen from now on	1
Just trying it out. Seems like a great app but has a really, really basic miss that I saw referenced in another review: Theres no intuitive way to specify or change the time of a task. Tasks are all just all automatically set for 9 am and theres not visable button or option to change the time. The other user mentioned trying to use Google to figure out how. But such a basic miss seems like a flag that maybe I should try a different app.	-1

I would rate this app 5 stars except I hate the way it scrambles all your tasks every time you change time zones. It's absolutely maddening if you have a lot of tasks because you'll be forced to re-priotitize every time. Going coast to coast with a layover and you'll be doing it three times. Ugh. [Update] Constantly crashing on my Galaxy Note 9 now. Like 20+ times a day.	-1

"* Adds new tasks to bottom, not top! * This app adds new tasks to the bottom of the To Do list, not to the top.

At least give me a setting to add new items to the top or the bottom of the list."	-1
Not bad It's a basic to-do list which establishes days when a project is to be completed and a list of tasks that were uncompleted. Uncomplicated and useful.

I love how simple this app is. I've tried full GTD systems, which are too complicated for me. By keeping things simple, this app forces you to prioritize. I don't need hundreds of tasks organized in a hierarchy, just a simple app to keep my goals in sight. This app does it with a beautiful easy-to-read interface. Tip: You have to be creative with the sorting order to make it work for you. For example, I sort my today list by: 1. Priority; 2. Habits first. 3. Time. It works beautifully for me.	1

"It really works!!.. I tried other apps like those that keep the phone locked. But ended up unlocking it more often,as a challenge. This one instead had my phone unlocked but it was nice to see the saplings bloom.. And whenever I peeked a look there was message like ""don't look here"" or ""focus"" as if I was being watched.. So it kept me from using the phone and I was able to concentrate. Really liked the app... Highly recommended.. Would recommend to all. 😁"	1

Awesome new idea for a productivity widget. Significantly more useful than a calendar or list of upcoming events. the one thing I would like to change would be the display of numbers on arcs. It looks kind of silly near the center of the circle when the numbers twist and overlap. Change that, 5 stars.	1

Good concept, works fine , helps to avoid phone addiction. But the problem with this app is that it crashes everytime when updated. Several times I installed and then uninstalled it. That led to loss of data and time. Tried your way , not available in my device. Problem still persists.	0

App itself is nice but needs a lot of polish. Right now it's kind of a bugfest.	0
With so many free calendar apps out there, there's just nothing in the free version of this one to make you choose it. The only feature that might set it apart from the competition is the project feature, but you have to pay to use it. Sure, you have the notes feature, but there are ways to accomplish the same thing in pretty much any other calendar, so I just can't see the point. Rather than pay for an upgrade to an app that's just ho-hum (the view isn't even very customizable), I'll be uninstalling.	-1

What To Say?	0
As far as calendars/task lists go, it's pretty much the same as every other one that's any decent. What sold me on purchasing this app was the crazy customizability of the desktop widgets. However, I'm still miffed about the crappy, out-of-date icons/emotes the devs are using, and that at least one of them all but refuses to get with the beautiful present with them (I use icons to quickly identify types of events on my desktop agenda widget - very useful).	0

Amazing app	1

The app has stopped synching and cant get it working very frustrating. I paid for premium and no one replies to help resolve which is a real shame as the actual app when working is very good.	-1
"They fixed the crashing issue. Awesome. My impression of the app was 5 stars after that. What brings me back though is the latest GUI change to the widget. 2 stars now. They took away the ability to easily select multiple tasks. I am considering switching task managers now. I do not see a way to restore the old functionality. Also I used to be able to launch ToDoist from the widget. That button is gone now too. I am a long time user. I've reached the """"enlightened"""" rating on the app. Boo..."	-1

I am quite liking this app.I could stay more focused than before.But o flaw that i met in this app is that U cannot pause the time. People may have to do something else or something important but then they have to give up and go to that work which results in whithering of one plant. Maybe you could provide a pause button but also take a note that if anyone hits press and opens any other app,it should automatically stop. Please keep that in mind.	1

Honestly, this app is not user friendly, is not intuitive. When I try to schedule a repeating task, it's confusing. After selecting a task to be repeated, I am asked how many days?! What the heck does that mean?! How the heck can I SIMPLY set a task to be repeated every day? Developers, where's the user guide?	0

I've been using Habitica for a few years now and while I love the idea, from a technical standpoint the mobile app is broken. It feels like something you would have on your phone back when touchscreens were a new thing. The most annoying bugs are: party screen not updating after you accept a quest invitation so you're not sure if you accepted it, spamming buffs sometimes reduces your mana without actually applying the buff and party chat not updating (have to restart the app to see new messages)	0
"This app is actually wonderful. I'm hoping you can add the ""forward"" and ""backward"" buttons on the widget (potentially just as another available function of those virtual buttons) like we have access to in the full app. It would be nice to click forward through the calendar and then, say, click the clock center to refresh and reload with the current time."	0

This app is really helpful. Earlier,I thought that to do list apps were useless and were a total waste of time. But this app is a real time saver. The reason is that earlier I had to think what I have to do and need to do in my mind, but now I can write in my to do list and get stress free	1
awww hes too cute!!wish i could`ve gone	1
whoa steady there mate don`t fall down	1
Needs all the sorting options on the widget that wunderlist has. I specially miss the Week setting. Also, colour coding of overdue dates on the planned widget setting, is missing. Also missing numbers on the drop down menu of the list, so you can't see how many listings are in each category. (with overdue listed too there) Will raise to 5 stars once that is fixed.	-1

After testing the app for a while, I was ready to purchase it but read on your user guide that searching for tasks is not available on Android. Do you know when it would be available? Also, is there a one time fee purchase option? Is there a GMAIL integration feature? Like Google Tasks? I like the minimalist simplistic clean look of your app 👍. Nice work on the Widgets 👍.

Great app. Just bought Platinum. My only issue is when setting my goal for a habit. Let's say I have a habit named '1 hour of study'. And I set my goal to doing this 5 times a day. Even if I would only do it twice (meaning 2 hours) each day the app would show it as a streak, even though I haven't reached my actual goal during any of the days. So it does see it as a success even though it wasn't for me. Could you maybe implement an option to make it possible to show those as unsuccessful?	1

Actually it is a good calendar app, but on Android 10 Google calendars cannot be synched without the Google Calendar app installed on your device. You have to sync your calendar by another calendar app, or all your BC2 events will stay on your local device only. So this means, that another calendar app is required to use this calendar app, which makes this app useless at the moment. I am waiting for a fix.	-1

It's not bad. But it seems greedy. Like, why do I have to pay to unlock individual color themes if I'm paying a monthly subscription? Also, LifeRPG was so much better than this.

Why can't I make an accomplishment like: learned blank piece of music, without having to tie it to accomplishing a certain number of tasks or reaching a certain level?	0

"Update: The accidental deletion problem described below is compounded by my now finding a ""confirm before deleting"" setting that simply does not work. The app is nice, but when starring or opening a list item it's easy to delete it. That's because deleting happens when you slide an item left, and that can happen by accident. Either add a working setting to optionally require confirmations of deletes, or provide a trash can from which you can recover deleted items."	0

EDIT/UPDATE - Purchased premium. Sync doesn't work. A quick glance at developers FB/Twitter accounts shows that they have basically dropped off the face of the Earth (no activity since 2018).

I genuinely think it is great, but I feel like there are still a lot of features that still can be improved. One of them is the whitelist feature. I bought the premium version in app, but I am not satisfied with it. The reason for that is the whitelist give to much leniency when planting trees. I plant the trees for various different reasons such as studying, excersising, relaxing, etc. However, I need some apps to be available in certain activity while unavailable in others. My suggestion is to apply different whitelists for different tags of activities. This will surely help me to be less distracted by other apps during a certain activity. I hope this improvement will be made and if so, I will gladly changed my ratings of the app.	0

"A little gem of an App. It is simple to use yet offers plenty of options for getting yourself organised and for list management. I find the 4 level hierarchy so useful. The hierarchies are Groups > Lists > Tasks > Steps but you can leave out level 1 if a particular list is not part of a group. I also like the fact that ""My Day"" is managed manually as this ensures that I actually bother to review it. Integration with Office 365 makes your plan available on all your devices and gives you a backup."	1
It's probably the closest app to what I'm looking for. I'd really like to be able to either style or disable monochrome mode, and have the option to use the same style between the watch face and home widget so I don't have to go back and forth in the settings to make them match	1

Love the idea but the app is so buggy and not too user friendly at points. First off, I can't change my character when creating an account because nothing pops up. It's just missing so I end up with a female characters. I have Galaxys10 and tried reinstalling app but nope, seems to be just a bug. Also, changing outfits just seems terrible to scroll through (the not user friendly part) The Good Idea is amazing! I really want this app to improve so I can incorporate this into my daily life.	0

"Update 02.04.20. I was using this for a while but I returned to my old task manager of 15 years (updated versions of course).

Once recurring tasks are implemented completely this will be superior!"	0

Overall I love the app but with the most recent update I'm experiencing an issue where it appears trees cost more coins than they display. For instance, I cannot purchase a 600 coin tree with 673 coins because I don't have enough coins. Also last night I had 1272 coins and bought a 600 coin tree, bringing my balance down to 501. If this could be fixed, I'd love to go to 5 stars. I literally use this app all the time.	1
Hello, im good thank you - tottaly tired, been working lots today...tottaly shattered! what about u	0
I like how minimalistic the app is. It's very easy to use and has just the necessary features. My biggest complaint is that I can't set a custom due date. Whenever I tap the due date, I get predefined reminder and I can't seem to change it no matter what. I'm using an LG Q7 Plus, don't know if it's a bug with the device or what. Will update the score if this issue ever gets fixed.	0

Any Microsoft product should have zero stars available. I cannot say strongly enough, if you love crashes, frustration and impossibly awful software. . . then get this app. Imports from Wunderlist do not stay put, they disappeared. Shared lists are now two different lists with the same name. One version shows only completed tasks, my fone shows incomplete. Thanks Bill for your 100% record of ruining everything you buy. Oh and 4.5 stars out of five?? I call BS. Look at the reviews.	-1

Love it, but it has some major flaws: (1) Can't personalize THEME. (2) Can't configurate WIDGETS' toolbars & what details are displayed. (3) The widget's size is too wide—max 4x?. Would love it if it were more flexible. (4) You cannot sort the notes on one day to be listed in ALPHABETICAL order on the Day widget; it will always be sorted by time. (5) The app malfunctions when you place two widgets on the home screen. (6) App stops working a lot for seemingly no reason.	0

This app is awesome, I love the wear os compatibility. I have a couple feature requests. It would be great if you could filter which calendars you can see on the greyscale mode. Also it would be nice to have an option in the settings for making the watch 24 hours always, currently if I restart my watch it switches back to 12 hours, so I have to turn on the tap to toggle feature, tap my watch, then turn off the tap to toggle feature since I don't want to accidentally switch it back.	1

Very competent App. I have actually migrated from Todoist after 3 years. Why? Because I piled everything into Todoist because of its wide functionality but couldn't see wood for the trees. Any one item could be a project header, a complicated task or a trivial one off task. I have now reverted to managing projects in appropriate software (in my case mindmanager with a task export to outlook and synch to ToDo ) and tasks in the very neat and focused ToDo app which grows on you as you use it.	1

Migrating from Wunderlist couldn't have been more painful. First I had to open Microsoft account just for this app. Then, importing from Wunderlist messed up owners, all lists that were shared to me ended up as mine, I had to re share them to the original owner again. Anyone invited to the list must have MS accounts, I had people leaving because of this. And I don't get any notifications when people add new tasks. It may look the same as Wunderlist, but the app is starting to annoy me...	0

The widget list is always glitching and won't show the items on my list, won't allow me to add new items to the list. The only way I seem to be able to fix this issue is by removing the widget and then putting it back in. This was never an issue in the past before I upgraded to the Microsoft ToDo. I'm using a Note10+ and my wife on a Samsung galaxy S10 has the same issue. Hope this can be fixed? It's getting really annoying.	-1

Longtime Wunderlist user. Slowly getting used to the ToDo app. So far it is ok. There are still some features that were not included from Wunderlist such as when a task is checked as completed, it has to be manually moved into a folder I created called Completed Tasks. In Wunderlist a completed task was automatically moved to a completed task folder. Would like to see this executed in ToDo. Thank you	0
ha ha, no, will be thankful i am not dragging them up a mountain today	1
its nice easy to use but has lots of functions	1
Loved this app until I recently realized that i dont use it half as much.It all started w/ a major update.If you click to put a task for tomorrow the calendar will still put you on the date of?So u then have to change it to tomorrow.THEN you have to go through not one but possibly 2-3 steps to tell it a time?On an analog clock?Its 2019 who still uses analog clocks? One step for the hour another for the minutes and ANOTHER for am/pm.& if u mess up thats it u have to start over. Too many steps	-1

very simle with few functions, maybe for childrens. there are missing a lot of usual functions that others free app have: time tracking, a true calendar where you add tasks by minutes steps, no task, subtask numbering, no tabel, spreadshets tasks, no custom fields, no timesheet , etc on this premium account. If you want and work with advanced GTD, planners, project management go away and dont lose your time.	0
Pretty disappointed that the first wall I hit is having to login or register. I get the whole cloud saving thing but at least give me the option and let the risk fall on me for data loss. The app looked promising and I was really impressed with the bit of pixel art I got to see. However, I'm not sure I want to sign up and allow access to my details or habits just yet.	-1
It's a good start, but I miss some of the simple capability of Wunderlist.	1
Worth paying for premium	1
Near perfect. Considering you only really need a piece of paper on the wall or a calendar to track habits. It does that and more with a clean UI. It also has nice features when you create a habit, download it to see what I mean. Discussion posts are a really nice bonus as well. Overall the app is gold.	1
....nope.. its for the 1st time we invited her at SSM and she very graceful accepted it !	1
It's no Wunderlist. Needs a quick add button on the app's home screen. Reminder notifications disappeared when I opened the app. I dislike that I am forced to use Microsoft account to use the app. Other than these issues, it's alright.	0

The app felt good enough for me to buy the yearly subscription, which I did and paid th 15€ it requested.

Another important feature missing is the ability to tell if I have future tasks scheduled when looking at the calendar. Currently the calander view shows days in a circle.

On top of the calendar it says to pick a day to see if i have a scheduled task. That is not efficient as i would need to go click each day one by one.	1

"It is pretty good, I use it everyday. However, I think adding recurring tasks is not very intuitive. You have to remember the ""every"" syntax. Some UI would help, especially for new users and non-native English speakers. Other than that, it's a pretty plain to-do list, does not include much gamification to keep you motivated to do what you have to do (other than setting a general goal number of tasks to do in a day or week). Reporting is a premium feature which comes in pretty thin too, you can only see a barchart of how many tasks you've completed each day in the past week or how many tasks you've completed every week in the past 4 weeks. For what it offers, the premium option feels a bit expensive."	1

Keeps failing to repeat some daily tasks. I've had to remake the same tasks several times because they just won't stick for some reason. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It's a complete gamble. Now it's more work just to figure out what tasks need done than it is to do the tasks themselves. Uninstalling. This app is more maintenance than my daily chores.	-1
play vanessa hudgens new songs plz or vfactory	0
overall a really good app. well thought. however, I would personally spend some time on the interface/interactions. it became too many steps for my preferences. realizing I needed to change a bunch of tasks, I had to pick a task, bottom right to edit, then tap below description, untick termless, select date, click ok top right, another ok top right. that's too much. I suggest adding swiping options to the task (look at nine email as an example). but overall good. might return one day :)	0

Good but why is there no widget? I just recently decided to try this app again. I like the reminders. Unlike some other users, this feature works fine for me. I also like that Alexa has a skill for it so I can just tell alexa to add something to my list and it's added. The only thing I would remove a star for is no widget. I dont want to have to open the app every time to see what's on my list.	0

Its not a bad app at all, but it could be better. If you could keep track of how often you complete a task that would be better. Like if you checked off every time you shampooed your hair it would be nice to keep track so you can change how much you shampoo if needed. Also i feel like having a bar at the top to switch between lists makes more sense than the way it is now. You should still give it a try if you need something like this because you might like it better than i did.	0

Real hassle to set up with synchronization with others. I cannot work out what the small red number on the icon relates to and cannot get rid of it, with wunderlist it related to completed tasks and once these were viewed the number disappeared. I much preferred wunderlist which worked fine. Why won't Microsoft leave well alone? I do not need this app to run my life, just keep lists which can be mine or shared.	-1

Hi, today the editing or deleting of events stoped working. When selected to be edited the event opens in a window without it's name and if you choose edit the window closes and goes back to the calendar. Also by swiping your finger on the list it can not be deleted. I really love the app, it's has worked perfectly so far but like this it's useless, please advise. Kind regards, Marta Santos	0
"Can't clean up old Alexa lists! We use this purely for the Alexa shopping list integration. However, early on it was very buggy, so we had to relink our Alexa account a number of times.

No, I can not, because it only deletes the working one!"	-1

"Help! GPS coordinates show up as phone numbers and/instead of a location. I enter the GPS coords in location, but in widget it shows the ""phone"" and ""map"" icons. Then when you select the event, but before edit, it shows it to be a phone number. I've bein dealing with it, but it's getting frustrating bc we use it 3-4 times a day I love the app, but this is just getting too much."	0
That is so sweet!! Have a good day	1
This app is really unique. It has made me interested again in being productive. It's almost like adopting a lifestyle! However, the app is currently having a problem with task reminders. It doesn't work most of the time and when it does, the alert is usually delayed by approx. 10 minutes. Also, it would be nice if the developers provided the ability to make task lists even when offline. Other than that, the app is perfect! Definitely recommend experiencing it!	1

Very good experience...	1
I used to love this (five stars) before you changed it. I was able to set repeatable tasks for each day of the week, but now if I set a repeating task today, for example, for every Wednesday, the reminder will come up today, not Wednesday. I want the reminder on the day I want. I am very disappointed. By the way, I won't use Any Do for my grocery list. I use a better one that keeps a running cost (including tax) for each store I go to.	1
It takes time burpt good but it keeps getting out like you can't login	1

would be perfect if I could organize the to-do's by date!! they're random right now	1

Potrebbe essere interessante ma molto lontano da Wunderlist. E' molto tempo che è partito il progetto e non capisco come non si sia riusciti a catturare le cose positive di Wunderlist ed inserirle in questa nuova app. Delete è troppo definitivo, creare un trash per recuperare le note e magari con cancellazione a tempo. Ho scaricato anche la versione desktop ed ha dei problemi che vado a segnalare. Al momento la tengo in stand-by in attesa di verificare le future release.	0
I really enjoyed this app but now if I delete a daily reminder I still get the notification for it! Which is highly annoying! Please fix this it distracts me from my work each time I here my notification go off for a deleted reminder	-1

Health widget stopped working after latest Android update. Note 8. AT&T. Interesting take on habit forming. I'm not really a gamer but I like the point system, leveling up, and buying accessories for your avatar with those points. Nerdy fun that seems to actually be motivating me in a way other habit trackers haven't been able to. (The TED talk on the inspiration for this app is really interesting too.)	1

This is a great app but... I purchased it to be able to use it with my Samsung gear s3, little did I know that I can't use it with my watch bc this app was made to be used with android wear (which I found out later my bad). So, will you be working on making this app compatible with Samsung gear? That would open your market quite a lot with Samsung gear users. I've been using the wearable app with my watch but it doesn't work smoothly at all. Please work on that if you can, thanks!	0

This is the App I never knew I needed. I got the free version because it sparked my interest and upgraded to the full paid version within a day. Maybe I'm wired to see my day in the way they present it or maybe Sectograph is wired to appeal to me, I'm not sure. Either way their widget is the top half of my home screen and I am more in touch with my schedule than I ever have been.	1

This app is completely unusable on my Note10+ The account creation is riddled with errors and when I finally get into the app, I can't click on any items or add a new item without the app instantly crashing. I was excited by the premise and motivated to start using it, but the experience was downright embarrassing. I'd love for a developer response here to acknowledge these problems and maybe offer some solutions.	-1
The app idea is great, but the actual app is kinda slow and a bit confusing to get around. The concept is very simple, yet the user interface is way too complex and has many features that I bet nobody really uses. Less buttons, more trees.	1

I really like this app. Getting to know all the little features that are included in the free version.

Used to be my go-to for my shopping list but 2 updates later it's become frustrating and wasteful. As I'm going through my saved items in each category to add it back to my list, the category just randomly closes and now I have to reopen it. Before I could just run down the list and click on what I needed to add.	-1

So it's just a demo to see if you would like to purchase the app. It says it does this so you can learn how to use the app. BUT it doesn't allow you to do anything because none of my info or calenders can be added to it because it's just a demo. So it's really hard to tell if I like something if I can't do anything on it. Something to think about if you actually want to make money selling an app. Just saying. Thanks for wasting my time while I'm trying to save time.	-1
thats real geek talk! haha...I feel you!	1
Hey, not anymore. I`m back now.	0
This app is a total rip-off! I stupidly paid for the one-time subscription of $35.00, had the app less than one hour. The print was so tiny I could barely see it. A lesson learned the hard way...no more app subscriptions for me. Users beware! Forewarned is forarmed. Hang on to your wallets if you try out this app!	-1

Absolutely love this app and found it far more suited to my needs than any of the bigger To Do apps. Looking forward to signing up for the paid version and giving 5 stars when the web integration is rolled out, then it will be absolutely perfect.	1
Downloaded the app...uninstalled within the 5 days they offer you for free. Now I noticed they charged me a full year subscription of 900+ INR. What a sneaky way to generate revenue....	-1

This app is inferior to Wunderlist as of now. It needs to be an option to duplicate a list exactly and rename it. You should also be able to attach pictures and instructions to long lists that you've made. It's just not nearly as intuitive as Wunderlist. I have 50 locations that often need all the same services performed and it is a major waste of time to type can01 can02 can03 can04 etc every time i have a sweeping maintenance issue.	-1

Edit: Uninstalled it, takes too much interest. Honestly I find it not working offline a major issue. I liked it but it is too slow and laggy not to mention the various bugs in game. Just today I was trying to add a new tag, I entered it about 5 times before I gave up and them 15 minutes later I find the tag I entered repeated 3 times, so I try to remove the other two. Also trying to organise the tasks' order, the keep going back to their original order. Sometimes when I finish a task and check it, it doesn't work. And in the habits it stops working some times and other times it checks the habit twice positive or twice negative.	0

"Hi. We migrated our lists from wunderlist. We use shared list but now even we shared the lists that were previously shared, they do not sync, so other people don't see the completed items. If they assign a task, they can't see it completed. There are duplicate lists with the same name, one is shared, the other one is not. When creating new shared lists, the people who received the invitation are unable to join. they see an error ""list unavailable"" I tried support, but unavailable."	0

It's fun, a great concept, but the app itself needs work. It locks up constantly and has to be manually shut down and then re-started, and the reminders basically don't work at all. Honestly I think it would be best to remove the reminder feature for now until it can be fixed, because not having a way to set one at all is better than using the feature and thinking you'll get a needed reminder when you won't because it doesn't actually work.	0
Terrible can't control whether things repeat it not and a study task is automatically a habit? Stupidly paid for the premium upfront. Agree with others that idk where 4.6 came from.	-1

I've been using the pro version for four years and loved it until recent year-end. During the holidays, daytime sync with Google Tasks stopped. When I wake each morning, I find that many or even most tasks have synced, but can't force any more syncs for the rest of day. I've reset and reinstalled the app without success. With the holidays over, I need to resolve this and get back to work, and find that I can download other competing apps that work great. Please fix.	1

Very versatile, keeps you on the track and highlights your strengths and weaknesses So impressed that I bought premium on very first day to have unlimited habits 4 stars only because there is no possibility to set monthly repeated task neither on a specific date (e.g. 3th of every month) nor on specific day (e.g. second Wednesday in a month) Otherwise it would be 5*	1

I usually don't write reviews. In fact, this is my first. But this app is worth a few words of appreciation! It works well, is easy to use, and helps me keep track of my activities/habits.

I'm kind of a geek....I like planners. I used to try out lots of different physical planners, then switched to trying out lots of planner apps. This is my current favorite. I love that it integrates with my calendars and that I can put specific times on my to-do tasks if I want....makes it so I can look at their calendar view and see all of my meetings AND my tasks based on when I'm planning to do them. I like being able to quickly schedule tasks, snooze tasks, schedule recurring tasks, etc.	1

There are glitches in the Android app that aren't in the web app. (I love the web app) Would give this 5 stars if Todoist fixed them, and introduce a bug reporting feature so that bugs like these don't remain unfixed. Dragging subtasks is often glitchy and doesn't parent under the correct parent task, or just reorders back to original placement after I drag it to a parent task. The @ and # symbol rarely actually pops up with label auto recognition as I type like it does on the web app.	-1

overall it gets the job done, but the notifications are confusing to set and are inconsistent when reminding you about your about. Some days I'm reminded and some I'm not, so it's kinda been up to me to remind myself. but the app itself is easy to use and effective at tracking.	1

(edit) Been using it for a while occasionally and every time it feels like a hassle to find what I need to reach within the app.. I only use the routines, no events or reminders, I have a separate app for that, Google Assistant wit a calendar. To add a change to one day it requires a lot of clicking to amend it.. I end up writing down the rest of the day tasks on paper, deleting, amending the times and adding them manually with the new times.. That's counterproductive. I need an easy way to move	-1

I'm changing my rating from 5 to 2. I've used this app for many years and I love it. It's a great app! But they have recently added add on videos (skippable but still 5 seconds long.. ) after you've created or closed an event in your calendar app. It's really annoying and disgusting because you don't have time watching adds when you want to add a couple of events everyday in you schedule... You've went to far Business Calendar 2...	-1

Excellent with a single exception. I've used Todoist for about 5 years and it's the best app in its class- the free version outperforms other paid apps in my experience. The one thing holding it back for me is the home screen widget. On my phone it struggles to load, lags, is unresponsive, won't select tasks properly,, the list may well go on- in short there are so many things which sometimes break, it rarely works. This is fundamental. 5 stars if fixed. Til then, it's a reluctant 3.	0

Reminders don't pop up if the app isn't open such as clearing all open tabs or if you haven't opened it at all in a day. I think that's why the app should be for, remind you because you may not have the time to. It's a good app but pls I'd like that this be worked on. I would also be nice if you can permit the option to pick alternating days or weeks as frequency of a task may not fall under weekly or daily. (e.g Tuesday, Thursdays and Saturdays).	1

The pomo section could be more useful if it has something like a timer. You set the time you need to focus then do the job rather than just pomo where there is a fixed amount of time 25 minutes at default. You know something like a focus timer, I guess it would not be bad, actually I think this might seem like copying a feature from other apps in your field but isn't it better if there's more functionality.	1

I get it you want me to upgrade, not even tried the app and you shove it in my face. I don't like at all how it's all just promoting your pro version Delete your account it wants your password for your Gmail account this is a privacy breach also.

I like how the app has options to write notes/journals for each day. It gives you the option to reflect on how you stuck to your habits. Most other apps don't have this feature. That said, I'm rating the app two stars because the notifications don't work for me. I have set times for reminders throughout the day, but the app sends me random notifications (reminders) when I don't want them. And on other days, no notifications at all. No app updates from the developer in over a year either.	-1
Excellent interface with a variety of easy to use options. I like the clear colourful month view with enough written information on screen to see what each day has recorded without having to tap on each individual day to view information. Much better than other calendars I've tried.	1

There's nothing wrong with this app, although it could be slightly better, but.... It's just like Google Calendar. In fact, it's integrated with Google Calendar, and all your events show up in GC. Even the selections of colors in association to events and how you input information is the same. If you're an android user, go ahead and just use the built in Google calendar, if not your Samsung/HTC/whatever one. I have near stock android, so I get Google. Same difference, really.	0

If you delete the app or transfer phones, you will lose everything! All past progress is gone and you can not get it back. You also can never use that login info again. Just keep that in mind. Also if you set your habit/goal for example twice a week, you'll still get reminders everyday. No options to change it to only notify when goal needs to be completed.	0

Absolutely fallen in love with this app!

This app is a great idea with poor execution. Reminders only sometimes appear, and the UI can be very unresponsive - I've checked daily tasks off, only to find that the app interpreted this as UNchecking the task (since it hadn't registered the fact that it is a new day, yet), which actually subtracts the game resources from you. These problems are significant enough to make the RPG-like rewards system ineffective for me, and the app not worth using as a habit-tracker at this time, sadly.	-1
Doesn't work at all like it should. Spent ages trying to set it up correctly but it just keeps letting me exit out of the app with no repercussions whatsoever. Pretty lame, since I just wasted a lot of time following FAQ's with 0 results. Well earned this 1 star as long as this isn't fixed.	-1

Since the last update, May 29, I have been losing random events. Tonight, I've added the same event four times over the last three hours. Just waiting to see if it disappears again. Several updates ago, the photos I attached to each profile stopped appearing. I think the OS was blamed. It's been a great app for several years but I'm afraid of what else I might lose in the near future.	0

UI can be improved. More rounded corners instead of hard corners. It makes the app look more modern. (my opinion)	0
I like that you can repeat task in certain time period from completion date. This sets this app apart from most other to do apps.	1
Kindly add daily focus time feature when we open monthly or yearly focus.daily focus time is available in many free pomodoro apps.i dono why it is npt available even in paid version.	0
As a to do list it works ok. Devs need to allow manual sorting of priority though. I think this app has much greater potential if it were to be integrated with Outlook including meetings & appointments along with tasks becoming more of an overall assistant rather than a to do list. One major gripe though, the point type on the widget is miniscule and barely readable.	0

One week of use & I purchased a subscription. I've used other similar apps, I enjoy this the most. There a few improvements needed, so I need to add suggestions to the Reddit page. I spent time & wrote out what I value in life, what my aspirations are, & then I narrowed down a few simple goals to reach those aspirations. Then I added my goals to this app. So far it's easy to keep track of my goals, habits, & how I'm doing. It's incredibly easy & even fun to use. Thank you for this app.	1

It constantly crashes and misses a lot of functionality. Hard to use and annoys with some popups that can be discarded only by closing app and then opening it again and permanent noticfaction that CAN'T be disabled. Payd 30 euro for this and used for month before it got so annoying that I started to look for another app. Fortunately I found one - Todoist. It's unbelievable how much better that is. Also there is version of todoist for PC, for your smart watch and even as browser extension which allows you to easily set a certain web page as task. And all these are synced.	-1

someone i work with today told me that if i took a 'real age' test, it would tell me i`m 45	0
"Tried it out. The time function, which is 90% of the app IMHO, is clunky. The default ""end"" time is ""until next activity"", but then it automatically changes to the start time of the next activity and you can't change it back. Then, if you add a task that overlaps other start times, it deletes the other activities. I spent 15 minutes setting up a schedule and was frustrated to find that I had erased my entire afternoon schedule because I made a mistake when changing the end time of something mid-day. This app was, for me, ironically, a waste of time."	-1
Everything is good. My only issue is that it doesn't send the message to you the exact moment you assigned it. Eg. I set a reminder at 8pm. The BOT only WhatsApped me 15mins later. Other than this, everything else is good. Love the feature of a WhatsApp reminder BOT. Improve on this area and you'll earn 1 more loyal customer	0

I really like any.do and having my to do list and events in the same place. However I have knocked off stars because I need more customisable repeat options and notifications. Sometimes my tasks are every two weeks, or every other day, or every 3 days. Would be nice for this option. I also like to put reminders in for my work calendar. I don't seem to get the option to change this when doing a new event reminder. Can't afford premium. Shame. Back to Google calendar. :(	0

For the first week of using it, everything was okay but suddenly all of my progress were gone. It was frustrating. And when I tried to use it again, the plant does not change with time. For example, when I adjusted the time to 1 hr, the plant is still a bush. I tried the max time but the plant is still a bush. So I uninstalled it. But it is still a good app.	-1
I want to love this more but I’m not heaps impressed that dark mode is free and native on iOS but not on Android. I use my devices a lot later at night and it would really help if this app would keep the dark theme the rest of my apps generally manage to keep. It’s also the one constant notification that annoys the pants off me as it is bright white against the dark screen.	1

Alarms or notifications don't work unless you open the app, then it floods all the notifications for the tasks as i open the app. Defeats the purpose of the app. Tedious round-about way to delete a Habit compared to deleting a Task. Not sure how this app got a 4.6 rating.	-1

They claimed they would give me my money back, but didn't so I had to go through my bank. I'm talking about $2.99. it's not a free app to get full functionality, so you end up paying extra. It's not useful for my purposes at all. I was hoping it would sync with Google contacts. The alarm is way too loud, and I don't understand how to use it. They deliberately give you the runaround, acting as if they're going to pay you back but they don't.	-1

Just got confirmed that itï¿½s pizza-time with some ex co-workers on friday...looking forward to it	1
"this app isn't optimized for use, it's just a concept. for example, the alarm plays music but can't be shut off. there's no ""acknowledge alarm"" so if it starts paying music... yeah it never stops. this is only one of many bugs so bad it breaks the app. don't waste your time."	-1

"App is good, have lot of features, but I would suggest one basic thing that needs to be changed. In ""Tasks"" app the menu can be reached by pressing the title icon. Also to change the list we have to press the icon on top left corner of widget. It is different (and little disturbing) from normal process we are following since many years. Please try to change the menu button on widget to the top left icon. Thanks"	0

I've tried plenty of pomodoro-esque apps and this one is the standout. Planting trees actually keeps me interested in focusing longer without distracting me from my work. I bought the premium upgrade months ago and haven't looked back. My one suggestion would be to work in break times. Typical pomodoro is work 25 mins, break for 5, work again, etc. Maybe have a popup asking if I want a 5 min break every 25 mins, a popup that can easily be ignored if I want to continue working instead.	1

User-friendly. STEPS and GROUPS are smart features! Options for repeat reminder are comprehensive. Love the colors! Suggestions: 1. Retain THEME COLOR for TASK. So when opening Planned, easier to distunguish which tasks are under Acads, Orgs, etc. 2. A better font style for tasks. 3. PLANNED. Please classify Next Week to specific days. It will also be great if I will be able to move tasks from Today to Tuesday next week with a press, hold, and swipe. Automatically updates the due date.	0

"**Update** After about 4years, I have grown frustrated with Todoist. The support team takes around a week to get back to premium members and almost ALWAYS w/ a generic ""thanks for your feedback but I'll say nothing tangible"" response, but 24hrs if you post publicly on Twitter - priorities seem to be off. Development has seriously plateaued. No significant features in a very long time. It seems like they are falling behind in the market."	0

Excellent if you use it properly. The only thing I would change is the notification and alarms settings. I want notifications to come through even when I'm not actively looking at the app. Right now, I'm not notified until I open the app and the pop-ups show up.	1

I have set up notifications on my activities to pop up before one minute of another activity, but it never works, I don't get any reminders or notifications before my activity.Please fix it.	0
the simple layout makes navigation easy and intuitive. I decided to try this as an alternative to Google calendar and whislt its integration of AI assistants and task tracking seems very good, as a calendar I have to say im not impressed. Looking at the calendar from a months perspective doesnt show at a glance which days you have something happening, rather, below the calendar is a schedule view which shows you what events you have which i find confusing. Would be nice to view by month.	0

Just installed and trying out (I'll update along with my experiences). UI/UX is pleasant and clear. Looks promising. Love the Free full-featured & Premium accessory-features philosophy; I'll pay later on to support development. ISSUES: 1) can't change start-date & repetition of a habit; if it'll break history data, at least allow duplication 2) would expect SCHEDULED days to be colored/marked in the single habit calendar, as future overview; not just as achievement overview. ## So far, good job!	1

I paid for premium when transitioning to a new phone, and my history was transferred. I recently had to un+re-install the App for personal reasons and it does not recognise my account anymore. Creator contact has not responded to numerous courteous emails. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. Wish I could get 3+ years of data back. I loved the App, and the App itself is 5 stars but will only rate 1 due to reasons above. Would change to 5 stars if resolved.	-1

I really like this app to establish a new routine. I strongly rely on my calendar at work but setting it up for routines outside of work is tedious. At first it takes a moment to understand how repeating activities are set up but now it's a great tool! Feature suggestion: it would be also really great if you could include a habit tracker into the same app.	1

This apps quite easy to use and looks simple. Just it doesn't really meet my requirements, it can be better if it got the calendar and tickbox. I've purchased it but it still like the same.
